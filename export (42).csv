5,"Which side of a house will get the most sunlight?  Articles on the internet seem to have conflicting answers. Is this because it is dependent on location?


This question depends on context.  

I could say the north side but for all I know the north side of your house has no windows.  
It also depends on geographic location.  Where does the sun rise/set.  
Do you have any trees/objects near your house that would obstruct light?  

There are varying factors here to say the least.  
"
9,"Which side of a house will get the most sunlight?  Articles on the internet seem to have conflicting answers. Is this because it is dependent on location?


In general, it depends on your location. In the northern hemisphere, the south side gets the bulk of the sun, because the sun is in that half of the sky. 
But if you are on a hill, or have a hill to the east or west, it can significantly shorten your solar 'day'.
Additionally, if you are in an area that tends to get morning fog, east-facing will get less effective sun than west-facing, because by afternoon the sun will have burned off the fog.
Finally, elevation matters. Higher floors will get more sun because they ""see"" more of the sky.
So in general, the south-west of the house will get the most sun, with upper floors receiving more than lower floors.

11,"I've got a big, lovely rhubarb plant in my yard which I'd hoped to be able to harvest a few different times over the course of a summer. How should I harvest my rhubarb to encourage it to regrow quickly? Should I cut it off near the base, pull it up from the root, or something else? Should I harvest it all at once, or should I leave some of the stalks in place?


I usually just ""snap"" off the stalks - a sharp yank on a shaft straight down is usually enough to free it.  
I typically only harvest the stalks that are above a certain size.  Though some folks just take all at once.  Rhubarb is pretty hardy - it will likely suffer through much punishment.  
"
12,"Which side of a house will get the most sunlight?  Articles on the internet seem to have conflicting answers. Is this because it is dependent on location?


I believe that in the northern hemisphere, it's always the south-facing side, and north-facing in the southern hemisphere.
Wikipedia's article on Seasons has a few nice images showing this.
"
14,"When I try to grow ""upside-down"" tomatoes, they always curve back up towards the sun and eventually break, causing massive damage.  Could I be doing something wrong, or is there a way to avoid this?


Tomatoes are very phototropic: the stalks will always grow towards light, so instead of pointing downwards, they try to curve upwards.  Also, the stalks themselves aren't very strong, so as they grow, the weight of new growth pulls the stalks over, causing the twisting and breaking.
"
17,"I have been told that debris/pollution from the road will find its way into my plants, but I don't know how much to be concerned about this.
We have a nice porch which could be used as a vegetable garden, but it is near a side street. It is, however, elevated from the street by a good 10-15'. Should I be concerned about toxins in my food?
What about a planter that is much closer? My neighbors have a vegetable garden that is set back about 20' from a major road (45 mph), at ground level. Should they be concerned?


It sounds like you would be safe from runoff being elevated that much above the street, but depending on the traffic level, you could still be getting fumes and such from passing cars.  I would personally plant there, but if you're leery of it, I would get your soil tested beforehand.

Tips for the lazy gardener has some info on growing vegetables in burlap sacks.  
Urban Agriculture has another way of doing things using wading pools.
Both obviously require drainage. But if you get creative, you could get two wading pools and move your sacks between them when it becomes too wet.

Yes, you can grow these in a container.
Here is one technique for growing potatoes in a limited area; you just plant the new crop over the old once you've harvested it.
In general the concerns are:

enough soil depth (for potatoes, a foot, for home-grown carrots, you may be able to get away with 8""), and
decent drainage, to avoid root rot/fungus.
sufficient light and watering.

Containers even give you the advantage of containing a blight or fungus infestation if one erupts.

21,"I'm trying to repair some patches in my lawn with grass seeds, but I can't seem to get the seeds to germinate. Is there anything that can be done to encourage germination?
In addition, the weather has been really changeable of late, so it's wet and cold for a few days and then hot and dry for others. Is there anything I can do to give the grass some consistent warmth and moisture? 


Some tips that have worked for me:

Loosen up the soil before scattering the seeds so that the seeds aren't trying to penetrate firm soil.
Mix the seeds with some compost or sand so that they're not all lying exposed on top of the soil.
Press the compost/seed mixture lightly into the existing soil.
Water twice a day until the new grass is established.

As for maintaining consistent moisture, you can reduce or eliminate the water on wet days and water it only on the dry ones. I wouldn't worry too much about the temperature variation as long as you're keeping the soil moist.

23,"I've got what I think is a cedar tree in my backyard that is missing most of its bark on one side from the ground to about 4' up. (Thanks to my puppy who is a shredding machine.) The branches next to the bare area of the trunk are slowly turning brown and dying. Is there any way to revive the tree and minimize the damage? Should I prune off branches that appear to be mostly dead?
Also, on the topic of preventative action: Are there products that successfully keep animals (dogs in my case) away from trees and shrubs?


Depending on how its root structure is doing, you may be out of luck. It is late in the season to be pruning trees back. For now, protect the tree (tie a bit of carpet around it at the heights the dog can get to) and keep it well watered.
As for keeping the dog away, you might ask on the pet website, but for a dog you own, you will need to do on-the-spot training. Let him go for the tree, then explain that it is YOUR property and he is not allowed near it. Do this a few dozen times...

25,"Which side of a house will get the most sunlight?  Articles on the internet seem to have conflicting answers. Is this because it is dependent on location?


A good (and kind of fun) way to answer this is with Google Earth. If you look up your address, then click the Sun icon, it will allow you to see the sun light based on season and time of day.

27,"I bought a small rose bush on Mother's Day this year and planted it in my flower garden. The area probably has too much shade for a full sun plant, but I don't think that is the issue here.
Shortly after planting, its leaves began to develop black splotches and fall off. The leaves are mostly gone at this point. What happened, and is there anything I can do to help it recover?
EDIT: I noticed last night that all of the leaves had fallen off and some new ones were starting to show up. What can I do to prevent these leaves from developing the same mold? Is now the time to apply manure tea or should I wait?


This sounds like it could be Blackspot fungus which is brought on by overly damp or humid conditions.  You may be watering too often, especially since it is already in a shady situation.  Fertilizing twice a year with manure tea helps to resist fungus.

Tree tubes can protect trees. They're mostly aimed at protecting young saplings from deer. 
Protective schemes to protect more mature trees from beavers can be more extreme.

31,"I live in Arizona, and I can never tell if I am watering my plants too little or too much. Plants are very touchy here - and you have to be able to read the signs correctly. I can't.
What signs are there for each?


There are various ceramic tools you can use, but I've never tried them. 
There are signs, tomatoes for instance, will have more fuzz on the sides to collect any water available
But most gardening books just say stick your thumb into the dirt, if it feels dry then it is time to water, don't wait till the plant turns brown. 
That being said, make sure you don't water too much and have some system of making sure your water gets down to the roots (a little berm perhaps).  That'll prevent your plant from keeping its roots up near the top of the soil where it dries out quicker.

I'm usually away for only a few days, but especially in summer my absence could be even a few weeks. The biggest problem so far is keeping the plants hydrated during the time that I'm absent from my university city.
One of the solutions that was suggested to me was Tropf Blumat system. Are there other ways of keeping them hydrated?


If you plant them in a small plant-pot, you could just take them with you when you move. It'd be a lot cheaper than an automated watering system and your chilli will appreciate the extra care.

The primary concern has historically been lead poisoning, but leaded gas started getting phased out in the US in 1973 and was finally banned in 1995. If your garden is in an older city neighborhood, then it is possible that you've got significant lead levels already. 

We have a nice porch which could be used as a vegetable garden, but it is near a side street. It is, however, elevated from the street by a good 10-15'. Should I be concerned about toxins in my food? 

The elevation makes me feel that it is safe enough for food production. Actual street-side would be something for flowers in my opinion. I've got neighbors who plant next to neighborhood roads with significant traffic (just on the other side of the sidewalk from the street), and they've been doing it for 20+ years. They've felt no concerns about pollution or toxins when I've asked them.

41,"How does putting my plants in a greenhouse help them grow? Is it purely to shield them from cold weather, or are there other benefits?


Primarily, greenhouses trap heat and moisture. 
Most plants prefer things warm and damp, so it's an ideal environment for growing fruit and germinating seeds.

42,"I have a hill beside my house with an approximate 25% grade.  What steps can I take to get a new lawn planted on this hillside, without it being washed away with erosion?  Would I need to put some kind of straw-like covering over it and secure that to the ground with stakes, or should just planting the seeds, fertilizing and watering be enough?


It depends how much rain/water flow the slope gets. Most places straw is sufficient. However in places of increased water flow it may be necessary to also add plastic netting (tied down of course with stakes). A more expensive option is to spray a (biodegradable) foam grass-seed solution that hardens and replaces both the straw and the netting. 
"
44,"How does putting my plants in a greenhouse help them grow? Is it purely to shield them from cold weather, or are there other benefits?


There are several benefits of a greenhouse:

accumulation of heat from the sun
possibility to regulate temperature and humidity
Protection from wind and excessive rain
protection from unwelcome pollens
limited protection from pests especially birds.

Typically you put in a greenhouse plants that prefer a warmer climate than the local one.

I have heard that an easy way to do an automatic watering system is to take a soda bottle and put a pin hole in the top. You can make the hole just small enough to have a drop of water come out at a time. 
Place the bottle cap down into your pot. This will provide a constant drip of water into your plant. Try it with a small bottle and test the hole to make sure only a very small drip is coming out. This would suffice for short trip.

49,"I have been growing a few varieties of chili pepper (incl. Scotch Bonnets) in my garden since April (Spring). Due to trees, other houses, etc., they only get about 6 hours of direct sunlight a day.
Is this amount of sunlight sufficient? Is there anything I can do to help them?


I've grown jalapeños on an east-facing, sky-obstructed apartment porch before. The problem is simply that the less sun you have, the smaller yield you're going to get. In my case, I only managed about 4 tiny peppers: enough for a batch of scrambled eggs. Generally with chili plants, the more sun the better!
So depending on your varieties and how many plants you grow, you might be able to get a large enough yield to be worth it, even if they aren't as big as peppers you might buy in store.

51,"I've never been totally successful in waiting till the exact opportune moment to till my garden and I don't suppose that I ever will be.  
I usually till my garden once or twice and when I'm ready to plant I am greeted with tremendous dirt clods (more than my 2 year old son has the tenacity to smash with a hammer).   I could till it again, but generally part of the garden is OK, so I plant a few rows and then find that I've got really bad conditions in the rest of the garden. So I get out the mantis and do what I can. 
What can I do after I've screwed up everything besides find a new part of my lawn to decimate? What I'd like would be some sort of soil amendment that can magically unclod my dirt as easily as I could do with a pitchfork or hammer after a good rain. 


Sounds like you may be tilling when it is too wet. Next time, wait until it dries out some more. Give your soil the squeeze test before tilling:

This test should be with soil from a 2 1/2 - 3' depth. 1. Pick up a handful of soil. 2. Squeeze it into a small ball. 3. Upon applying pressure to the ball the ball should crumble. If your fingers' pressure causes it to compress more, it is still still too wet to till.

This time, assuming it is dry enough now, you should be able to just run the tiller through it again to break up the clods.
You might also want to check if you have high enough organic matter in the soil. I find that adding gobs of compost over time makes it so I don't get big dirt clumps.

If it's a shaded part of the garden, you could grow something that likes part shade and grows pretty big, like turnips, kohlrabi, kale, brussels sprouts, cauliflower or broccoli and mulch the pants off of that section.

In my opinion, those covers are a bad idea. They create a breeding ground for fungi.
I think the idea is that they keep the soil moist while the seeds are germinating. I can see through your cover that you have plants up. I have had good luck with uncovered trays and simply keeping the soil moist during germination. (I have had fungus problems in the past when I've tried to keep them covered.)
At any rate, it's unlikely that the condensation is blocking enough sun to drop the temperature inside very far, and not below your optimum range for germination.

Normally, you want to see condensation on your seed tray. It indicates there's a moist atmosphere inside, which is just what the seeds need to germinate. It doesn't block the light in any meaningful way.
I can see that you've got nice green seedlings there, so you're doing great.

Pepper plants can survive short periods with very little water at all, but I find their fruit lose their structure and become soft. In other words it doesn't sound like a good idea.
Here in North Texas the locals tell me you need good hot weather for hot, spicy peppers. So that is something worth trying, although I find the fruits tend not to set during the hottest months of summer. (I usually grow sweet or mildly spicey varieties)

The covers help as they not only trap the water, but they also trap the heat inside which allows for better control of soil temperature.
Each species of seed has an optimal soil temperature at which the highest percentage of seeds sown will germinate in the shortest amount of time. Most seed distributors will print this temperature in the seed catalog or on the seed package.

and

Micronutrients are those elements essential for plant growth which are needed in only very small (micro) quantities. The micronutrients are boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), chloride (Cl), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn).

I don't know about ""properly"", but what we have done on three beds (and it seems to work) is:
Start with roughly 50/50 mix of cheap topsoil bags (tend to be very sandy) and the more expensive garden soil/compost. This will settle to perhaps 50–60% of the alleged contents of the bags. So keep topping up over the next few years when the beds are empty.
Although I might occasionally add the cheap topsoil bags to a young bed that requires a lot of topping-up, I usually top up with ""Shrub compost"" (Lowes sell it in big bags intended for trees and shrubs, but it seems to work very well for peppers and tomatoes); our home-made compost; and ""used"" potting compost (i.e. from pots which have had plants in them).

Firstly, would a mango seed actually grow in my area? Secondly, I'm pretty new to any kind of plant life. So, does anyone have any information on germinating and planting a mango seed?


As to germinating, the information that I can find says to plant with the rounded end up. Wrap it in a damp paper towel in a baggie and keep it someplace warm for a week to a month. Check it to make sure it doesn't mold. If it starts to mold, take it out and plant it.
But that has little to do with where you live. I could get Mango to germinate here in zone 5.
Mango is hardy to zone 10-11. Phoenix is zone 9. You may have trouble with winter kill.
You might be able to make it work if you have a site (or can create a microclimate) that stays warmer. Or if you can find a variety of mango (if such a thing exists, I don't know) that is hardier than the zone 10-11 that I found listed.

If you live in the desert your best bet is to use top soils/composts from elsewhere. Just create the raised bed using wood or rock, then fill in the area with a mix of sand and soil.
If you live in a place where vegetables have a better chance with the native soil, try just adding compost. You'll still need to transfer soil from one part of your yard to another if you want to use a raised bed (which, admittedly, can help with drainage) but it'll be a bit cheaper to start than all of the bags of soil you'd have to purchase from your local nursery.

I'm having good results with Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis), but I don't think aphids are listed on the label as being controlled by it. The main problem I'm solving with Bt is cabbage loopers.
Wikipedia says:

Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), Coleoptera (beetles), hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants and sawflies) and nematodes.

In the past it has grown almost like a weed in our pots on our deck here in North Texas. Admittedly we deliberately help it to re-seed itself: we grow it as an annual and winter frosts kill it.

But, I'm just wondering if it's a good idea to repaint the bare metal because I think it would make them dull (not to mention leech into the soil). 
How could I make them look good either way?


My guess is that painting the metal would not hold up well. Shovels and Pitchforks in use basically will run up against things which cause the paint to chip off fairly quickly. I would just try to clean the rust off. A wire brush or a wire brush wheel would probably work well to clean them up. 
As far as the handles, you may want to consider just replacing the handles. Most of the shovels and pitchforks I have seen laying around my grandparents house had a bolt that was used to hold the handle to the metal. I can remember helping my grandpa replace these handles pretty regularly as we broke them over the years.

You should turn it to get air in, and to mix stuff up (rather than a lump of grass cuttings, a lump of veg peelings, etc). We have a tumbler and don't turn it anywhere enough out of simple laziness. combined with too many fluids this can result in a smelly anoxic black mess. I think the tumbler was meant to be turned daily, but I usually try to do it every time I put something in.

You don't need to turn it at all.  But, the typical wisdom is that the more frequently you turn it the faster it will turn into the black stuff you want.
Don't waste your money on a tumbler.  Just make a big pile - then eventually you can also have dividers for different maturity piles.  (Discarded pallets work great for that)

I use pyretheum. Is it organic enough for your needs? Depends. Back in the UK ""pyretheum"" is the 'natural' variant made from chrysanthenums (and the one I used to go for); and ""pyrethins"" are the synthetic equivalent. But here in the US there does not appear to be any distinction and everything is labeled ""pyrethin"" plus various claims to being a natural pesticide.
Pyretheums are particularly good for delicate plants (I've used them on carnivorous plants - don't laugh!, but hear they're also good for orchids) and veg/fruit. Even though they break down quickly, you would still wash the fruit of course.

But, I'm just wondering if it's a good idea to repaint the bare metal because I think it would make them dull (not to mention leech into the soil). 
How could I make them look good either way?


I wouldn't paint, it will scrape off quickly.
Standard advice on preventing rust that I've heard is to take a 5 gallon bucket, fill it with sand, and put a quart of oil in it. When you're done with a tool, shove it in the bucket to give it a coating and it won't rust.
I don't like the idea of petroleum on my food-garden tools, so I'd substitute some kind of veg oil, even at the risk of it becoming rancid over time.

111,"I'm going to be moving into my first house soon in Westchester County, NY. I've done a lot of container and patio/balcony gardening and am looking forward to having a real backyard garden.  I want to start composting with worms but am not sure if they are self-sustainable.  
I'm ok with having to buy worms every season (I see that the red wiggler is the worm to get) but am curious about the experience of other vermicomposters in NY and the Northeast.  I've read that an active compost pile can have a temp of 125 degrees Fahrenheit. I assume that worms will move out of my compost material when it gets that hot but what happens in the winter when it gets near zero?  


This might be an off topic answer since it doesn't involve wintering directly in your heap, but you can keep worms in a large rubbermade container in your (new) garage, feed them some of the stuff you'd put in your compost pile (cantaloupes perhaps).

What is the proper way to know when and how much to aerate? Also, since I have a small lawn, is there such a thing as a small lawn aerator and will it get the job done?
Edit:
As it turns out, there is a small aerator, like this one:

I purchased one recently and it works rather well. Obviously not a good choice for a sizable lawn, but for my small lawn this worked extremely well. I'm seeing some improvement already in the grass gradually becoming more green.


You can aerate your lawn with a sturdy pitchfork (as well as weed it). But I'd imagine you'd have a hard time doing it when things get too dry or cold. I don't know if there is a bad time to do it while it is possible. 
You can also spread compost around your lawn, adding nutrients might fix some of the problems you have with hardpacked soil.

I'm assuming you want to keep using these tools, and not just clean them up for display.  I'd avoid painting them, at least with anything you'd pick up at the local Home Depot.  There are, of course, ways of applying paint to metal that are more durable (think of they guys who are painting and repainting cars using professional spray gear), but that's probably not worth the effort here.  The best way I've found is just to make sure you clean them up and store them in a place that allows them to dry out and stay dry.  I know people who use the oil and sand technique for over-wintering, but I've never had the nerve or space to have a large bucket of sand in my shed.  I do sometimes use a little mineral oil and a rag, which probably works almost as well when you're storing tools for a few wet, winter months.

118,"What techniques can be used to discourage cilantro from bolting too quickly? I plant them and it seems that they almost immediately go to seed after they've reached maturity.


I've found cilantro to be a tough one for avoiding bolting (at least in the Seattle area).  I've never seen any different varieties that claim to have more or less bolting tendencies.  The only thing I've every really been able to do is to work around the bolting by continuous planting, so you have plants that are at different points in their growth.  You could also see if it helps to move to an area with less sun, though that will also slow their growth in general.  You could try starting them indoors, getting a fair amount of growth, then moving them outside to a slightly cooler, shadier spot in the garden.

120,"I have several african violets in special clay pots. The pots kind of resemble a double boiler, and the lower pot is filled with water, then the upper section, containing the plant, is unglazed on its bottom half. 
If I add fertilizer to the water in the lower pot, will it diffuse through the clay to the soil? Or do I need to apply it directly to the soil or directly water the violet every now and then?


That depends largely on the fertilizer. 
Most ""liquid fertilizers"" are made up of  soluble salts that will pass through the porous clay wall. But if the fertilizer contains an organic component, some of the ingredients will not be in solution, but only suspended in the fertilizer. That suspended material will likely be filtered out by the clay surface.
Try dissolving some of the fertilizer in a clear glass with some water and let it sit. If you do not see material settling on the bottom of the glass, it will almost certainly permeate the clay pot. If you see a lot of particulate matter settling on the bottom, it probably will not be able to penetrate the clay surface.

135,"I currently live in a condo with a limited sized balcony.  Which vegetables work out best for a small garden?


Leaf lettuce is always a good choice. It is easy to grow and does not require a lot of sun (if you have a shaded space) and actually bolts quickly if it gets too hot. Also, leaf lettuce can be grown easily in a smaller pot. It is cheap to grow and expensive to buy at the supermarket.
Also, a vine-type plant can be good if you don't mind losing some of your balcony railings. This would include cucumbers and some varieties of peas.
If you have lots of sun, most pepper varieties should work because they grow mostly up and not out. Peppers like company and as long as the soil is warm and the temperature is up, you can fit a lot in a smaller space.

136,"I currently live in a condo with a limited sized balcony.  Which vegetables work out best for a small garden?


Pretty much any of the dwarf varieties of vegetables will grow in pots - Thumbelina Carrots, those little round beetroot, etc...

Your local garden centre will be able to advise, or get a seed catalogue and be amazed at the choice!

Some things that can work on a small area situation includes a variety of containers that can be used in different ways. A way that has been succesful is the upside down hanging tomato planter. If you can hang it five or six feet off the ground you will have good results. Large containers such as 5 gallon paint cans can grow just about any vegetable or herb. Earth Boxes are a good choice, and decreases maintenance.

Bamboo is one of the best materials. It is durable and lasts year in and out. If you have access to bamboo take advantage of the natural resources available. You can use as a pole and tie up the tomatoes or make it into a teepee style. Many garden shops will carry this material in bundles.

175,"Does using greywater on your fruit and vegetable garden affect your health in a negative way?
Greywater is the run-off or cast off water that lolls about when you do normal washing around the home. The sink water when you're doing the dishes, the ejected liquid that comes from the laundry, etc. Most of it involves the suds and afterwash of soapy conditions.
Will eating the fruits of plants fed greywater do anything to a human that normal watering from the heavens above (rain) or from the tap (without rinsing through soap beforehand) won't?


Adding soap to water allows the water to dissolve oils. However pure water, as we all know, doesn't mix with oils. Since plants contain many vital oils and lipids crucial to their life, and rely on how these oils interact with plain water they absorb, soapy water would alter the fundamental chemistry at work and could only be toxic the plant.
So it really depends how gray your gray water is. Pure water is always best, but you might be able to get away with some very unsoapy gray water. I recommended testing on a plant you don't really care for.

The main problem with searching via picture or description is the amount of time that you'll spend examining each result trying to locate your plant. There's no ""Google for plants"" (yet), so the amount of time it'll take you to find what you're looking for is probably going to be tremendous.

Basil, and herbs in general, do not need to be fertilized. Consider that basil grew well in Mediterranean geographies in the crags of rocks. So don't overwater, fertilize, or put it anywhere but in full sun.

You shouldn't necessarily be worried about the nutrient content as much as the loam of the soil. You don't want a soil that is too sandy, clay-y, or full of too much organic matter. The rule of thumb is to have around 15-20% organic matter and a soil that drains well.

Doing this, you can still have cilantro in the Fall when you usually have said goodbye to it several months ago.

What to do about it depends on how you want to control it.  It's an annual/biennial, so individual plants shouldn't last more than two years, but it spreads like crazy via seed.  If you don't want to use chemicals, I suggest just keep pulling out plants (which have shallow root systems and are easy to pull), making sure you get any adults before they produce and disperse seed. Could take a few years doing it this way as there's probably a considerable seed bank.  Alternatively, look into safe herbicides for a faster result.

I'm sure the answer depends on the fruit type and the particular tree. In the case of peaches, I've heard it suggested that you should thin every other fruit so that the remaining fruit grow large.

If the weeds have gone to seed, any seeds in the compost mix will likely germinate when you come to use the compost. These, you have to dispose of differently.
Otherwise: 

Put the pulled weeds into a light-blocking sack for a week to make sure they don't have any energy to grow in the compost. 
Cut them up into small pieces to break their roots and leaves and encourage faster composting. A chipper is great for this if you have one, but I just use secateurs.
Put the shredded weeds into a covered composter. You can bury them if the compost material if you don't have a cover.

After this kind of treatment, even the hardiest of dandelions should give up and compost properly. Provided you break up the roots, they shouldn't give you any problems.

230,"I live in Arizona, and I can never tell if I am watering my plants too little or too much. Plants are very touchy here - and you have to be able to read the signs correctly. I can't.
What signs are there for each?


If you say your plant is very sensitive to over-watering, I assume it is a kind of plant that doesn't like a lot of water.  The key is to know how much water your plant needs. Try googling for more info regarding your plant. The season also matters; in the summer you should water your plants more often, while in the winter you should reduce your watering.
My advice is to stick your fingers into the soil. If it is completely dry, you may want to water it. However, if the weather is not hot and the plant hates water, you can wait and see for a couple of days. Otherwise, you can water it when the soil is dry.
When you water the plant, you have to pour the water gently and keep watering until the water comes out of the pot. This makes sure the water gets to the root and not just the top layer of soil.

Well, you can't stop zucchini(courgettes) from growing and they're prolific growers.

turns into big sticky clumps instead of nice fine dirt. Needless to say, this
is less than ideal for planting.
Is there anything I can do to the soil to improve this situation? Any treatments
or substances I should be tilling into it to make it easier to work with and more
accommodating to my plants? Any special equipment that would make tilling easier?


I'm in much the same boat I usually ruin half the garden.  I've tried just not tilling it and that certainly works, in subsequent years you may be able to just use compost you turn into the soil with a pitch fork and double digging. 
If you tilled it when you absolutely knew everything was dry it would be too late to plant cool season crops.  So... Maybe plant tomatoes and cukes and zucchini on the side of the garden you want to till in the dry season and get that soil good and worked up.  Then repeat on the opposite side next year.  By the third year you may have a garden that requires much less tilling.

245,"One of my tomato plants (Better Boys if that matters) has a few leaves that have started yellowing on the lower branches. Not sure if they aren't getting enough water, or if they are diseased or what. 
What is causing this? If it's a disease how can I prevent it from spreading to the rest of my plants?


You probably can pinch the lower branches off, and actually help the growth of the plant.  Your plant can grow pretty big (4 feet) so to encourage tall growth (and keep the leaves away from the dirt, which probably caused the yellowing) pull them out.
If it goes on, pull the plant out (don't compost it) and be thankful it is early in the year.  
It's probably not the water,  unless you're watering directly on top of the plant and causing them to get muddy.  Try watering at the base and making a little dirt moat around the plant so that the water goes into the ground and the roots have to grow down to get it.

246,"Holy cats, that was a nice storm last night. 100 MPH gusts have flattened my 12in tall tomatoes, cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage.
This morning I straightened them out by propping them up with a little dirt or straw.  
What is the best way to straighten these plants?  Will they straighten themselves? should I just toss the ones that can't fix themselves?  Have I just re-decimated my entire crop?


Plants are more hardy than we give them credit for. Try giving them a little support and see if they catch on in a week. Usually for tomatoes, a cage like this is necessary to provide support for the plant when growing and also when it bears fruit. All of mine have one similar to this and they really like it.

Similarly for cauliflowers/broccoli, giving some form of support should bring them back to life. Also, it is important that you provide support as soon as possible, before the plant starts drying out at the broken places. There is a higher chance of it surviving the lesser you wait.
Lastly, as a disclaimer: I have never experienced a storm, so I don't know the scale of destruction you're talking about :)

248,"Last year I grew a little stand (4x4) of short-season corn.  I hand-pollinated it and everything was growing great.  But I waited a little too long, I guess, and when I picked it, my corn tasted horribly starchy.  
What is the best way to know when to pick it?


One way of telling if your corn is ready is by looking at the little tuft of fine silky corn hair that hangs out from the husk. If it is nice and dark till the tip of the husk, it is ready to be harvested. If it is still pale and light in color, then you ought to wait a little longer.
You can also peel back the layers at the very top just a little and see if the corn kernels there are ready. If they are, then the rest of the corn is ready too. You can also tell if they are nice and juicy by feeling them or pricking them. This is perhaps the best stage to harvest them. If you wait longer, as you say, it will taste starchy and chewy.

If you start by laying them by the house, you can line them up much easier with the edge of the house. This will eliminate the need to trim the pavers at the house (you'll probably have to cut/trim the pavers at the other end of the patio) and make that edge look much neater.

If you're willing to grow veggies, snap peas are great!  They don't need much tending, they're one of the first things to pop out of the soil in the spring, long before the last frost.  And they are one of the best things to snack on straight off the vine.  They can be planted densely, will climb any trellis you give them without much direction.  And they will fix nitrogen into your soil, lowering your need for fertilizers (which can be important for containers).
Minor downside, the varieties I'm familiar with don't do well with the hot summer sun, and they will die out before then.  Major upside, you can easily get several successive harvests in both the spring and the fall.  I like to let a small percentage of mine dry out on the vine in the fall, and then I collect them and plant them next spring.

Generally, they just need to be buried in the compost heap.

272,"I'm from a very rural area and love to garden, however, for work I just moved into an apartment in the city. I miss being able to grow vegetables and so I attempted to start some leaf lettuce indoors, however, almost every plant died quickly. 
I'm just curious, does anyone have experience growing vegetables indoors? What are the best ones for this? What sort of planter do you use? Do they need to be directly next to a window? How often should they be watered? I'm not used to not having Mother Nature help me out with my plants
Any tips that can be provided would be much appreciated, thanks!


Herbs are generally going to be your best bet, and a windowsill of fresh herbs for cooking is a great thing, but I'm not sure if this is going to fit your need for vegetables.
Vegetables would be easier if you have a little extra space to work with, such as a deck or maybe a window planter that you could attach to the outside of your sill.  After that, it's a standard question of appropriate light and temperature.  I've seen people grow bush tomatoes in a 1 foot by 1 foot container on a sunny apartment sill.
Lettuce or other simple leafy greens should be a pretty good plant to grow, though you may have to harvest them when they are small.  Perhaps yours got too hot or dried out in the window you had them in?  Were they getting at least a few hours of direct, or even indirect light each day?

273,"We have a compost bin to which I've been adding kitchen scraps (and some garden waste) over several years. I have never used the resulting compost (mainly because I have a ready supply of horse manure which is easier to work with). Why we still add to it, I don't know. Just habit maybe.
The bin never fills right up because the base material just keeps compressing and rotting down.
Is this compost now better than ever or is the stuff at the bottom now too far gone (is ""too far gone"" even possible with compost?)


I don't think ""too far gone"" is possible. If it gets too anoxic then spreading it out on your beds and giving it a day or so to aerate will fix that.
Eventually all the carbon will reduce (=>peat/lignite) in low oxygen conditions;  or oxidize (=>carbon dioxide) in high oxygen conditions.

275,"The potting soil in question is in medium to large sized pots that had/have tomatoes or small fruit trees in them.


The only two problems I can think of would be disease and nutrients. There are some diseases (eg. fungi and nematodes) which will linger in soil, so you really need to treat the soil or discard it to somewhere where the disease is not a problem (ie. a different kind of plant).
As for nutrients, these could be topped up with liquid feed or top dressing. I find potting compost settles / compacts quite a bit so there's usually space for top dressing each year. I also re-use potting compost by putting it on raised beds or filling small hollows in the lawn. It isn't the best medium for the latter, but every little bit helps.

Dustbins are sometimes mentioned but they're too large surely.


Why not just purchase some flower pots. Either terra cotta or even plastic. Place a piece of carboard or plastic over the holes and then if you have trouble with them blowing away you could just put a rock or something over them. Dustbins would work fine as from my understanding all you are looking for with forcing is darkness.
Another thought that occurred to me was an oatmeal container (water might be an issue as they are generally made from paper or cardboard), I'm not sure from the picture how tall the forcing pots are, but if you have something that size hanging around why not just use that.

It all depends on what was initially potted inside of the soil, to add onto @winwaed you can actually boil some water and pour it into the soil to kill any bacteria or disease.  The other thing you can do is use some fungicide to get rid of anything harmful.
Although top soil is fairly inexpensive its a major profit margin for these garden retailers like home depot, lowes, randazzo's, etc.  They want people to toss the stuff out and buy new soil each and every year.  To me this is a total waste of money and another way to make a dollar off of you.  To you a bag of decent top soil is a mere 3-4 bucks...but multiply that by thousands of people buying that stuff and this could be just for one store!
You can always mix it up with some new soil if you still insist on buying new top soil.

281,"I have a lemon and a satsuma tree in my yard that I planted roughly 2 years ago. So they are still fairly young. I planted them in a bad location and realized that in a few years they are going to end up taking over the area. So I would like to move them, but a few people warned me that it is a bad idea to do so and that the trees would die.
While I know that is a risk, are there any steps I can take while moving them to put the odds back in my favor? What time of the year would it be best to move them?


You didn't mention where you are from. I am assuming Florida / the south / the west. 
The best time is when it is not flowering.  One thing to make sure is if whether the soil it is currently growing in is the same type of soil you are moving it to.  The tree is a living thing, so if anything such as: temperature, soil, moisture, humidity, light, etc changes then the tree will be in shock.  It means the planned move should not hinder the tree based on these conditions.  If it does you are risking the lifetime of the tree, it may / may not be dead if the move greatly impacts the tree.
The good thing about all of this is 2 years is not that long for a tree. If it were 1 it would even be a lot simpler, but 2 is still doable.  Because of the short timing the roots aren't deep at all, you may be able to dig a cone / circle around the thing and expect the entire ball to come out.
Good luck

Growing potatoes in mounds is a great way to grow them because it saves you from having to dig into the soil to pull up your potatoes.
Potatoes never grow any lower than where you planted your original seed potato, but you can grow them as high as the growing season will allow. 
There are methods for growing potatoes up columns of tires which you might want to investigate.  
Someone else will have to answer definitively how high to mound them, you should be able to cover most of the plant without hurting it.

291,"I got one of these snazzy paper pot makers and made a ton of pots to grow all sorts of stuff.

I put a little bit of masking tape on them just to keep it together until I filled them with dirt.  
What should you do with the pot when you plant it to make sure the seedling had the optimum chance of growing and the roots take... root in the soil?


If it is just a paper pot, I would suggest that you plant it along with the paper. Paper disintegrates very easily and within a couple of watering cycles, most of it will have become mushy and the roots won't have any trouble in growing right through it. Also, by not disturbing the contents, it is less of a ""shock"" for the plant.

Another reason for crop rotation, I believe, is that nutritional needs and intake vary slightly from one vegetable group to another; therefore, growing the same group on the same plot year after year may deplete the soil of a particular nutrient and lead to unhealthy crops.

Trees might survive it, but unless you are sure what is in the paint (solvent, pigment, fixative, etc) then dumping paint on top soil is generally a bad thing to do. Even relatively simple solvents which you think would break down or evaporate in a matter of days/weeks/months, can contaminate the water table for years.

In addition to the answers above, my local gardening center had the following suggestions which are really simple solutions

Gophers aren't fond of strong smells. So dumping some coffee grounds in their tunnels should drive them away. Also, the dryer sheets (fabric softeners, I think) which are strongly scented should do the trick.
This is useful for people with indoor cats as pets. The suggestion is to put used cat litter in their tunnels and fresh mounds. Gophers, being rodents are natural prey for cats and the scent of a cat in the litter is enough to scare them away. 

Both of these should serve as good alternatives to using traps/poison, but as Randy points out, traps are pretty cheap (I had just assumed they might not be)

I agree with winwaed that it doesn't have to be a strict rotation.
One other thing you could consider is the various ""Green manure"" crops. If you are having trouble working out what comes next on a bed, or don't really want legumes - then green manure is normally cheap (at least in bulk), improves the soil and will help keep weeds down in an otherwise quiet time on your plots.
You can also use Green Manure as part of the rotation (""green manure"" is a term used for crops that grow well, can crowd out weeds and decompose easily). This appears to be a contentious subject though. Using as suggested here is fine... but you might be better growing something ""real"" - even if only to give the produce away.

There are many reasons plants might not successfully reproduce in a season, and there's really no way of preventing seeds from prematurely aborting unless you find out exactly why it happened, and even then it could still be out of your control (i.e. if it's down to the tree's ability to breed successfully).

Insulating may not be necessary. You can be proactive and increase the output of your compost pile if you (a) take note of what you are composting and refer to the C:N Ratio (Carbon:Nitrogen) (b) address lower temperatures by adding things like leaves, sawdust, or ash and other nitrogen-heavy components.

I'd say it depends on how much paint and what type.
Water-based paint such as latex shouldn't hurt anything if it's sufficiently diluted and in small quantities. I've repainted every room in my house since moving in last year, and I washed out all my brushes, paint trays, etc. in the same spot in my backyard. The grass there hasn't shown any ill effects, and the tree that's about 15' away is completely healthy and unaffected.
However, if you're dumping a half-gallon or so of left-over paint, I'd advise against it. Why not keep the paint in case you have to touch-up your project in the future? Even if you're moving, I'm sure the next owners of your house would appreciate having the matching paint for any touch-ups they may need to make.

Some crops actually prefer to be planted in the same place every year. (i.e. Nightshade family [tomatoes, potatoes etc..]).  
Three rotations is a bit much for me, and probably most other Wisconsin gardeners.  I can usually do radishes and then zucchini; spinach and then kale (not a good rotation, but a practical one); peas and then cucumbers. 
But companion planting seems much more suitable, fun, functional, verdant and beautiful. You can get the full benefit of crop rotation, without the wait and uncertainty. 
No garden is uniform (except my grandpa's, who grew his on an old dump full of leaves, slag and manufacturers glass) and there's something like 20,000 different types of soil which would mean that it might not even be efficient or wise to rotate your crops if they do better in different parts of your garden.

I've read that I really ought to be pruning the tomatoes to the ""main vine"", which will result in higher fruit yields.  But I'm not sure how to tell which vine is the ""main"" vine (or if it really matters), and which vines are just branches.  After a week, both vines look rather strong.  And when both vines have flowers, I'm anxious about cutting away potential produce!  Will pruning it really result in higher yields?

Check out this video. I use these techniques with my tomato plants with good results.
Summary:

Leave two leaders (main stems).
Prune all other suckers.
Start when suckers 3"" length.
Prune every week to 10 days.

340,"I grow several types of dahlias every year, and dig up the tubers in late Fall to keep them for next year.  I cover them in potting compost and put them in the back corner of my basement which is dark, cool and dry.  I use fresh compost every year.
I often find that I'll lose some of the tubers (one year I lost them all!) by the following Spring: they'll be crumbly and dried out and fall to pieces as I take them out of the compost.
What can I do to prevent this from happening?


I did a similar thing with tiger lilies that were taking over my garden, although this is more accidental an anecdotal than it is scientific. I was digging up the tiger lilies and I threw them all into a black trash bag.  I kept the trash bag in my tool shed, where it would certainly get very cold in the winter, and the next year I discovered them, so I replanted them in some corners of my yard.  Most of them took the next year and are flowering this year. 
Alternatively, I'd imagine you could apply a thick mulch (i.e. full unopened bags of leaves) to your dahlias, then divide them in the spring.

341,"Most of my strawberry plants have leaves that first turned red, then brown and brittle. Leaves often snap off when harvesting what berries remain after the critters get them.
I'm trying to balance watering - I've been holding off a bit more on the watering since the berries are sitting on the ground and were rotting before ripening. The leaves began turning before I cut back on the watering.
It's my first time growing strawberries so I'm not sure what to do.


So, you probably accepted that they're toast this year so don't bother with chemical treatments.  Just pick bad looking ones out and let the runners grow for next year. 
The fruits should probably not be on the bare earth regardless of the condition of the plant.  Maybe you need some mulch, that would kill two (or three) birds with one stone: 

the ground would retain moisture (the roots are really shallow for strawberries); 
weeds would be contained; 
the fruits would not touch the ground.

342,"I've never bought seedlings out of seed catalogs, but am sometimes tempted to (especially by the flashy free $20, no obligation seed catalogs).  
I'm just wondering what the considerations are when ordering seedlings by mail.  I worked in a postal distribution center once and I don't think we would have taken too special precaution not to disturb the roots of any box (although we tried to be very careful when someone sends baby chicks).  Not to mention the unnatural darkness of the mail truck and the time it takes to get from place to place, the possible pressure changes caused by driving through mountains or air mail, etc.
Anyway, are mail order plants OK or should any be specifically avoided?  


I've had both success and failure at ordering seedlings. The best advice I can give is to look up reviews online for the catalog you're buying from. If they're mostly positive reviews I'd try it out.
Also go for a quicker shipping time.

Experienced companies will take care to pack the roots very well. Do plan on higher mortality than you would when buying from a nursery.
You might check state laws, which control interstate agriculture. California, where I live, is pretty strict, as far as I can tell. For example sometimes live plants can't be shipped into particular states, but seeds can. I have had very good luck with tree seedlings, such that I now have many ~6' cypress trees, where I had only expected a couple to survive.
"
348,"Generally seed packets have some kind of expiry date on them. I've got ""sow by"" dates on my packets of Suttons seeds and ""best before"" on Unwins.
Is it worth sowing seeds which have passed their expiry dates? And would the answer vary from plant to plant (e.g. can I be more relaxed about expiry dates for plants that are ""easy"" to grow, like salads and radishes)?
Also, if I persist with out-of-date seeds, will the results consist of:
a) fewer successful germinations 
or
b) weaker, less productive adult plants
or both?
Is there any evidence seed companies apply these expiry dates cynically, in order to generate extra sales of newer seeds?


Less germinations would be my experience. Once the seedlings get a good start, then age of the seed is almost certainly irrelevant compared to growing conditions (nutrients, water, sun, etc).
Is it worth it? I would say yes as you don't lose anything. However, if you are short of space, you may want to use more productive seed instead.
A few months ago I planted some old red yucca seed which I found in the shed. I don't have anything to compare against, but as we'd forgotten where they came from, they are ""old"". Planted them on the off chance and some are coming up. So in a few years I'll have lots of yuccas and not know what to do with them!

350,"We know that urine can do a plant good. Certain plants (like citrus trees) will absolutely do well if you add urine to their intake.
But urine is very high in nitrogen and could potentially ""burn"" the plant. What are some common plants/trees that can flourish with urine as a fertilizer? Is there some way to tell which ones to avoid, lest they shrivel up and choke on the nitrogen?


Urine is very high in nitrogen. One can observe how plants handle the quantities humans would produce by observing the yards of people with large dogs. Plants usually get ""burned"" from the quantity of nitrogen deposited by the dogs. 
If your compost heap has a lot of straw/cellulose, then it probably needs more nitrogen. 
If you want to use your own stuff to fertilize plants, mix it about 50% with water in a bucket (or watering can) then apply it to plants. Fill the bucket/watering can indoors, and wash it out afterwards.

I bought a few fruit trees, a grapevine, and eight blueberry bushes from Fedco Trees last spring, and all survived. I know people who have bought hundreds of bareroot Christmas trees through the mail, with good survival rates.
In my experience, the plants are very young (so don't have huge root systems) and the roots are packed in wet shredded newspaper (which retains moisture well) and the whole thing is sealed in a plastic bag.
You can make a ""test purchase"" of just a couple of items to see how well they package the plants and what condition they arrive in. This will give you a good idea of whether you want to trust that company to package a larger order properly.

356,"I put squash seeds in with my compost at the end of last year, and apparently it didn't get heated up enough to kill everything. I now have Delicata plants with dinner-plate sized leaves growing out of it.    
One of the plants has nice, healthy, 4 and 6 inch squash hanging off of it.
Another of the plants has produced a 10-foot runner with a little squash every foot or so, but every one of those squash has shriveled up after the flower closed up. I had always thought they only did that when they didn't get pollinated, so I went as far as going out there with a small paintbrush and transferring pollen from the male flowers to the female flowers, and the squash still did that.
Could it still be a pollination issue, or would a nutrient imbalance cause the squash to shrivel up?


If you were intentionally saving seed, you would have wanted 1/2 mile isolation distance (or bagging and hand-pollination) for the parent plants to be sure that you had seed that wasn't crossed with some other type of squash. If you grew a different variety of squash (C. pepo) last year, or if anyone in your neighborhood was growing any variety of C. pepo at the same time last year, your volunteers could be crossed with another variety -- possibly in strange ways.
So if you have a volunteer that looks and fruits like the parent, that one must not have been crossed. Consider yourself lucky and enjoy the squash.
It's possible that the unproductive volunteer is crossed in a way that makes it unable to produce fruit.
If both the healthy and unhealthy plant are growing in the same soil, a nutrient imbalance seems unlikely.

I've bought plenty of samples domestically in Australia with a fairly high (>90%) success rate.  I find that people who care enough to grow & sell plants generally care enough to pack & ship them correctly.

Be wary of long distance haulage though, where plants may be stored in cold storage areas for potentially long periods of time.

370,"Does anyone have any plant recommendations that could deter mosquitoes? The location is North Texas, and I am looking for something that could be used on or around the deck. This might make the deck more comfortable in summer, but it may also deter them coming in the back door when it is open for the dog (we don't have a dog flap and it is a glass door).
So pots might be the most convenient, but there's a bed below the longest length of the deck, and there's additional space for new (small) beds if need be. It should not smell bad to humans, and ideally be decorative (edible works too!).
None of the botanical solutions seem to work. Citronella never seems to work, and those candles have a low melting point - ie. They can get messy if left out in the Texas summer heat. I've heard of aromatic wood chips being used, but it seems we'd need a lot and they'd require regular replenishment - ie. expensive over the long term. 


I have tried Citronella plant, Lemon Thyme, Lemon Balm, and Catnip.   About the only thing that actually worked was rubbing Catnip leaves on my exposed skin, and that didn't deter them for particularly long.   They all smell nice, though, and the cats enjoy having fresh catnip.

The choices I'm looking at right now are hardwood, cedar, and cypress (all available from my local Lowes/Home Depot/etc and are pretty cheap.  Also, my city has a program that gathers wood that people are throwing away and shreds them into mulch.  It's free to take some and they'll fill up the back of your truck for you as many times as you want.  You end up with a random collection of wood...not sure if this really matters though.


For water retention and weed suppression, a thicker layer of mulch is generally better (3"" is the rule of thumb I have been using). Since you have access to free recycled mulch, take advantage of that for a thick base layer. 
If you want to improve the appearance, lay a thin layer of bark on top -- saves money and look good too. I have used hardwood, cedar, and cypress without any noticeable deleterious effects. Since you say you have a truck, it might be cheaper to buy this mulch in bulk at a nursery.

373,"When I grow radishes, I find that some of them don't swell up to form the globe I expect; instead the root stays thin.  These are planted in the same bed and at the same time as radishes that do swell.

What can I do to make all of my radishes plump and juicy?


You're certainly doing everything right if most of your radishes end up being plump and delicious!  But you're always going to get a few thin ones mixed in with the normally-shaped roots due to the nature of plant reproduction and genetics.  There's nothing you can do to make those radishes plump up.

Provided that you can provide enough water, tomatoes are not difficult to grow in summer. Just go to your local garden center and buy some varieties that look like you would want to eat them.  If your weather is above 85 degrees, most tomatoes will flower but not set fruit.  Find a variety that sets fruit in hot weather — perhaps something like HEATWAVE.

Several other questions address how to make inexpensive cages, pruning, and upside down potting.

Carrots are pretty easy. We planted some here (in Las Vegas) in February, then harvested them in mid-May.

This could also simply be a Nitrogen deficiency.   The plant will transfer Nitrogen from the lower, older leaves up to the upper, newer ones if it doesn't have enough available Nitrogen in the soil.   Feeding with fish emulsion (There are a few brands, and what your local store has will probably depend on what region you're in: My local Home Depot carries it). would give it an immediate boost, or you could use something else with a medium to high N number on the fertilizer bag.

peppers and tomatoes do well in warm weather as already suggested.
For cool, wet winters, you might have some success with potatoes if you do not get a frost. I've grown them in a Texas spring but it is a race to grow and water them before it gets too hot!
Beans and corn could also be worth trying. Corn is thirsty, but black beans don't seem to do too badly. I could never find the right time to pick corn (like eating pears, the window is very short!), but black beans seemed to be much more forgiving. I could also get two crops in a Texas summer by keeping half the first crop's beans and then planting them in August.

If you're new to gardening in general, you might start off trying to grow your own herbs.   Basil, mint, thyme, rosemary, and sage are all really easy to grow and handle neglect reasonably well.   Most of the perennial herbs will handle a wide range of climates, and the annuals will generally self-sow quite happily (that may or may not be a good thing, depending on how you feel about them growing everywhere).
There's nothing like cooking with fresh herbs that you picked right before they went into the dish.

I have found the easiest to be spinach beet (perpetual spinach — it needs to be protected from slugs and well watered), followed by broad beans and sweet corn. Carrots can be difficult, as they are susceptible to a host of pests and diseases, including carrot fly and black rot. Onion sets are easy enough to grow, provided you avoid the red varieties, such as Red Baron, which have a tendency to bolt (go to seed) before they have fully swelled and, as a result, they don't store well.

If you are a beginner and are looking for the cheapest setup I would just say do it yourself.  Build something from scratch from an online tutorial.  Instructables has numerous tutorials on different setups and the costs associated to them.

I was thinking about grabbing some more bamboo stakes (Already use them for tomatoes) and putting one at each end of the row with a string strung across and letting them climb up that. Will this work and if not is there a better way to do it?


There's a lot of ways to do this, and I'm not sure there's a wrong way.  The green beans will climb whatever you put up.  You just need to make sure that once they get bigger that the bamboo stakes will be able to support the combined weight of all the bean plants.
If it were me, I would give each plant something vertical to climb.  If the only support your plants have in the middle is a horizontal string it will be a little more difficult to get them to go up on their own (depending on how close together your horizontal strings are).  So, I would run some vertical strings too...going from the top to the bottom.
Again, if it were me, I would probably build a lightweight wood frame and run horizontal and vertical strings across it every 5-6 inches.
That being said, people sometimes tell me that I tend to go a little ""over-board"" when it comes to garden utility structures, so you're bamboo stakes may fine as you described.

I know that I should be mulching some of my veggies.  But in practice I never have.  Here are some alternatives to mulching that have (mostly) worked well for me:

Plant the crops much closer than you normally would.  Their own leaves will shade the ground (protecting moisture) and they'll crowd out weeds.
Companion plant a ground cover crop with a taller crop.  Two examples: I grow oregano around the base of my peppers, and ""three sisters"" uses squash as ""mulch"" for the beans and corn.

You can also use a plain old black trash bag or a tarp or a burlap bag.  Some of these materials are water permeable, but some are not.  Either way you need to be very diligent about getting water into the soil, because rain will behave differently on these than on bare soil or straw or wood mulch.  The upside is that it a black covering will also warm the soil (for the plants that like that sort of thing).

I think slugs and/or snails. You say it would be impossible for one to get in but I think it would be impossible to exclude them, really. In fact the plastic covering would be providing exactly the kind of environment they love, with all that trapped moisture.
Night time is their favourite feeding time.
Try some slug pellets (assuming you don't object in principle). That would soon confirm (or otherwise) if it's slugs: you would quickly be seeing dead slugs, if I am right.

The classic method for supporting beans is a line of A-Frames with horizontal poles across the top. 

Make the structure somewhat stronger than you think is going to be needed. Consider providing more canes/poles than you have bean plants for extra strength. The full mature bean plants are going to be surprisingly heavy.
In the past, due to shortage of canes, I haven't sometimes built it as strong as I should have. Then found it buckles under the weight of the mature plant, and/or that a strong wind has torn some of it down.

I agree with Tea Drinker - your seedlings are almost certainly providing a feast for slugs and/or snails. Apparently, slugs can eat up to forty times their weight daily! As an alternative to taking the steps already mentioned, you could protect your seedlings with a netting grow tunnel (which would also protect them against bird damage and the heat of the sun) - see photo - provided you ensure beforehand that the soil over which you are going to place the tunnel is slug-free. I grow both lettuce and seedlings under one, and it works a treat.

Don't really have plant based solution, but if you just want a potential organic solution to keep mosquitoes in your general area in check, then you could build a couple of bat houses.  Mosquitoes are some of bats favorite food and if you can successfully attract bats to live in the houses you provide, they'll cause the mosquito population in your area to drop pretty significantly.

Wood chips if you have them. Vegetable kitchen waste will also help to balance C:N. (meat is usually advised against because it can attract rodents)
[edit] Wood chips can be quite small - eg. from prunings from shrubs. Also if you really are short of prunings and veg kitchen waste, you could always buy a bag of deciduous wood chip mulch from a garden center.

421,"Since the pre-sprouted plant season is in full bloom, what is a good indicator of the time to transfer a pre-sprouted plant? For instance I have a mexi-bell pepper in a plastic pod and two basil sprouts. The pepper is about 8"" and seems primed to be transplanted now to a pot. The basil is 5"" and seems constricted.

Is height the best indicator; should I also balance that against leaf and stalk health? 
Will certain considerations wither once transplanted? If so, what are the sure signs a plant is constricted and getting worse because it's not in the ground or a pot?



Most peppers, tomatoes, and herbs are ready to be transplanted into your garden when they have formed 4-6 new leaves and are around 4"" tall.  When your plant is outgrowing its pot it will start to fall over (top heavy) and wilt easily (roots fighting to survive).  As long as your weather is not freezing, get those babies outside! Remember to harden off any indoor plants for a few days before transferring them outdoors. I also crunch up egg shells in the bottom of my hole when transplanting peppers and tomatoes to fight off blossom end rot ( a calcium deficiency)!  Good luck!

427,"Is it safe to use snail pellets in a vegetable garden bed or will these slowly leach into the soil? Is there a safer alternative that will keep snails out, but won't be absorbed by the vegetables?


I have tried many different things succesfully. Try putting a container dug into the soil. Fill this with beer and the snails will go to the beer and they will drown. This also works for slugs. Another way is to sprinkle ashes from the fireplace or campfire around your plants. The ashes will kill the snail. Salt is another way to kill them. Sprinkle on the outside of the garden and it will do the same thing as the ashes. Where we garden in Jamaica the snails will go up into the trees at night so we cover the ground around the tree with ashes and soon we did not see any snails in the trees.

431,"I have a lemon tree that is 8 years old. I didn't water it enough during its first years, and as a result it's only 2 meters (6 feet) high. How and when should I prune my lemon tree to stimulate its growth?


Depending on your location you will want to prune any time from January to March (or June to August in the southern hemisphere).  If you are in Florida a good time to prune is generally end of January or beginning of February.
Look for any dead branches and get rid of these first.
You will then want to trim branches that are towards the middle of the tree, that way you allow for more sunlight and the flow of air, this all promotes healthy growth.
Do not prune branches that are healthy, there is no reason to do that.  You will want to prune only if the branch is dead, it takes away sunlight from the lemon tree, or it forces the tree to grow in an awkward position.
There is a youtube video on it.

432,"I have a pomegranate tree that is 6 years old. It didn't get enough water for several years, and was growing under a canopy of other trees, so it only grew about 1 meter (~4 feet) high. How and when should I prune it to stimulate growth?


Depending where you Are from you can prune in early spring before any new leaves or flowers come out.  If you are in a very warm climate you can also prune after all of the fruit is taken in late fall.  Prune or cut at an angle to avoid damaging the tree and prune any dead branches.

433,"I had my soil tested last fall. As part of the submission I checked the box that said I use manure as a soil amendment / fertilizer.
In the results from the lab, they included a note that said that manure is a good source of many necessary nutrients, but it is not a good idea to rely on it as the sole source of nutrients over the long term.
Unfortunately they didn't say why. What's wrong with adding a bit of manure to my garden every year? (I have vast amounts of horse manure at my disposal.)


I believe the lab folks mean to say that you shouldn't only depend on manure, there are other alternatives.  I do not believe they meant it as being harmful to your garden.  In fact, it is very normal to use as an a fertilizing agent to a garden, there are tons of nutrients that garden plants benefit from manure.  I would say as long as it isn't a meat eating animals manure you have nothing to worry about.

I would prune the tree in early-ish spring, whenever that is in your time zone, since that gives new shoots (which you want) time to ripen in preparation for winter or hot weather.
As JonH said, just prune for shape and structure and health: maybe have a couple sturdy branches to establish the frame, etc. etc, have an open center, get rid of diseased branches or misplaced branches... You wouldn't want to prune too much though, as citrus doesn't respond well to too much branch loss (15-20% max).
Another thing you could do is remove the flowers/young-fruit to encourage growth in other areas of the tree.

The special horizontal root a spider plant also has is called a rhizome.
You can separate them without hurting them. Ideally such division would be done after growth stops (during dormancy) or after flowering. You want to just water well, then lift and pry the root ball apart into separate plants and trim any damaged/dead roots from the divisions, and repot.

438,"I want to try growing vegetables. What is an easy veggie to start with? I live in a climate with hot, dry summers and cool rainy winters.


In California, my brother threw some cucumber seeds in the ground in April and we had nearly a cucumber every two days starting in July. They seem to grow extremely easily once established. 
Other than cucumbers, like others, I would say tomatoes and Swiss Chard, which do decent in hot weather. I find other greens hard to grow since they bolt quickly in warm springtimes.

439,"Does anyone have any plant recommendations that could deter mosquitoes? The location is North Texas, and I am looking for something that could be used on or around the deck. This might make the deck more comfortable in summer, but it may also deter them coming in the back door when it is open for the dog (we don't have a dog flap and it is a glass door).
So pots might be the most convenient, but there's a bed below the longest length of the deck, and there's additional space for new (small) beds if need be. It should not smell bad to humans, and ideally be decorative (edible works too!).
None of the botanical solutions seem to work. Citronella never seems to work, and those candles have a low melting point - ie. They can get messy if left out in the Texas summer heat. I've heard of aromatic wood chips being used, but it seems we'd need a lot and they'd require regular replenishment - ie. expensive over the long term. 


Nothing stops mosquitoes. I tried many plants including carnivorous plants, but carnivorous plants actually attract bugs and eat them, and they need a humid environment to grow, which gives a good place for mosquitoes (more food indeed).

The first thing you can do is to check your surroundings for standing water and eliminate them.
The next thing you should do is to use a mosquito net to prevent mosquitoes biting you when you are sleep.
Finally, buy an electrical mosquito swatter and have fun!

444,"I have a couple 3 foot tall ficus trees which have some thin aerial roots descending from the branches.  I keep both indoors, and they do not get a lot of sunlight.  However, when I purchased them 2 months ago, they already had these aerial roots.
Would trimming the aerial roots have any major impact on the health of the tree?  If so, are there things I can do to offset these effects?  I have seen some trees that never seem to grow these types of roots, is this species dependent or environmentally determined?


Its very normal to have these aerial roots and trimming them should not affect the tree in any way.  There are hundreds of different types of ficus trees this could be one of the reasons why you have not seen these types of roots in the past.  It all depends on the type of ficus tree.
By the way those are some nice trees congrats!

446,"I plant maincrop potatoes every year. Last year, I planted 50 Desiree in mid-April, in the usual way (15"" apart, in rows 2' apart, in light, sandy soil that had been conditioned and fertilised several weeks earlier), and I harvested them in August. The yield was higher than usual and they all looked very healthy; however, their texture, when cooked (steamed), was very disappointing: extremely dry and crumbly - so dry that they were only fit to eat mashed with butter. Has anyone had a similar experience and, if so, do you know why this happens? We had a prolonged dry spell when the tubers were forming, and I am wondering if I failed to water them sufficiently..


If the texture is as you have described, crumbly, this generally points to the amount of water given to these plants.  It means there was definitely a lack of water, potatoes tend to really hate dry spells, so you must water them well during droughts!

If so this can definately be the cause of all this sap, that much is definately not normal.
Ensure that you are not providing additional water and that there is adequate drainage for this tree other wise you will notice the branches begin to die out.

449,"We inherited blackcurrants, gooseberries, raspberries and strawberries when we moved into our current property ten years ago.

What's the recommended lifespan for strawberries and raspberries? 


There isn't a set timeframe, but for strawberries and raspberries, you can usually get a good 3 seasons out of these fruits before it is time to replace.  So I usually stick with 3-4 years, and you will definately notice it as the yield of fruit decreases as time goes on.

455,"When I grow radishes, I find that some of them don't swell up to form the globe I expect; instead the root stays thin.  These are planted in the same bed and at the same time as radishes that do swell.  I believe I'm doing everything right: cultivating the soil before planting, thinning the seedlings, keeping them well watered (when Mother Nature doesn't do it for me) and rotating crops from year to year.
What can I do to make all of my radishes plump and juicy?


I've had it be that case that all of my radishes failed to plump and that was because I failed to properly cultivate my soil and left them to grow between craggy, rocky, ugly soil.  
So... As Shanna says, perhaps there's nothing you can do to make them all plump up.  But there is plenty you can do to screw them all up so be vigilant.

Raspberries can grow productively longer, to around 10 years, as long as you rejuvenate/prune the fruiting canes properly. Strawberries, like JonH said, get around 3 productive years of fruit-bearing before they succumb to disease and age, giving it a lifespan of 4 years or so.

460,"I have 4 small chili plants (sorry not sure what variety they are), they have 3 sets of leaves. I re-potted them from a seed tray about 2 weeks ago. I'm a bit concerned the plant pot is too big? When growing from seeds how many times should I re-pot and into what sizes?



That would be the smallest pot I would use for those plants. I only re-pot once (from the seed tray). Of course re-potting disturbs them and sets them back a bit. Also the roots can get tangled (hence the disturbance).
Over the last 2-3 years, I've come to the realization that peppers do much better in raised beds or normal beds, rather than pots. I have had reasonable size adult plants in pots that size or larger (pepperocini come to mind, although this year's are slow growing), but they tend to be the exception.
Ornamental peppers seem to do fine in pots as well, but ornamentals are generally smaller plants to start with.
Of course pots might be the only option, in which case I think you have to live with smaller plants and less fruit.

461,"I have this neglected rose bush in my garden. It seems too long and spindly? How and when should I prune it?



Pruning for this rose bush should be done in early spring or late fall.  Roses seem to respond well to pruning so either would work.  
Prune at an angle and follow each rose down to the base of the long stem. Cut about 1/4 inch away from the main trunk. Be mindful of any new budding stems, if the stem looks like it is budding its best to skip that stem.
"
484,"Very early this year (starting in mid-May) my peonies' foliage was covered in whitish-gray powdery mold.  What is it and what if anything should I do about it?


Without a visual, I think it sounds like powdery mildew, which is a fungus that is encouraged by dry, perhaps shaded, conditions and lack of air movement.  Depending on the host plant, leaving the infection untreated can lead to leaf loss and weakening of the plant.  To control it organically, prune out infected tissue, being sure not to shake it around as this can spread the fungal spores, and dispose of the prunings by burning them or putting them out with the rubbish rather than adding them to your compost.  If you want to treat it with fungicide, check with your local garden centre to see what's available, or investigate online.  To prevent it in the future, ensure that your peonies are well-watered and mulched, and improve air circulation around them, if necessary.  Perhaps they need dividing?

486,"I came across a very beautiful aloe in a shop a few days ago, which I would like to plant in my office next to my computer. However, there is no natural light (sunlight) and only fluorescent light, which hangs 2 m (6 ft) above the table, is available.
Can aloe grow healthily in such conditions?
The aloe is a small one, with an 8 cm diameter (~4 inches) pot 


You are dealing with a very sensitive plant.  Aloe's require a lot of sun and love hot weather.  Unless you are working outdoors in the sun you will not see this plant flourish.  I have never tried growing one indoors but what you can try is to use some cactus soil mix with very good drainage.  If you are planting a new one do not bury it too deep, the plant likes to be on the surface of a pot.  You must water very well in the beginning until it drains out of the bottom of the pot.
But again without any sunshine it is hard to say what will happen to this plant.

Chicken manure is an excellent resource because it contains the highest N-P-K rating amongst all other organic matter, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  The japanese people do know what they are doing when it comes to mixing this type of manure with bonsai.  I would say only a handful of organic matter is needed.

I also don't have a drip system (yes, I water all my plants/trees manually) yet and have plans to get one in a few months. 
My question is: should I wait to install the drip system and pipings first before mulching or is it possible to do it afterwards too?


It's definitely possible to do it afterwards.  Since mulch is typically pretty light-weight you can just plan on raking it to the side when you get ready to lay down your drip system.  You would only need to move the mulch in the lines where you're laying down the drip line, then rake the mulch back over it and you're in business!  I did this exact same thing in my backyard last year so I wouldn't have to keep battling the weeds between then and when I finally have time to put in irrigation and plants.

My main uncertainty is at what size a pumpkin needs to be before extracting seeds of any sort.
Beyond that, my plan is to do the following:

Extract seeds from pumpkin
Dry seeds for 1 day (2 of it is humid)
Place seeds in freezer for 2 to 3 days
Thaw seeds, begin germination process in a 85f, enclosed, lit greenhouse container

Is there anything noteworthy that I can do to encourage my pumpkins to provide viable seeds sooner than later?


In ""Seed to Seed"" (Suzanne Ashworth), p116:

Winter squash or pumpkins used for seed saving must be grown until fully mature.
...
Squash [or pumpkins] have a greater number of viable seeds when cut from the vine and left to sit for three weeks or longer.

For your contest, I think you will need to focus on getting your 1st generation plants to produce a higher yield. (Possibly by encouraging the plant to set more, smaller fruit, but I don't know how you'd do that.) Or through rooting cuttings like you ask in your other question.

Aloes, like most succulents, are very hardy and will withstand considerable neglect . I have had two Lace Aloes (A.aristata) in a low-lit, sunless room for several years, and they are thriving. The winter temperature in this room is sometimes as low as 7 degrees celsius (44.6F) and they are quite happy. Aloes like a marked difference between day and night temperatures. Make sure your potting compost is light and well-draining, and water thoroughly in summer, but very infrequently in winter. Aloes - at least the Lace variety - can manage perfectly well without sunshine and, provided there is some daylight in your office, the one you have in mind should adjust well enough to the conditions you describe.

Edit:
As it turns out, there is a small aerator, like this one:

I purchased one recently and it works rather well. Obviously not a good choice for a sizable lawn, but for my small lawn this worked extremely well. I'm seeing some improvement already in the grass gradually becoming more green.

I'm assuming mid-morning in full sun is optimum, because there's time for the heat to kill the weed debris and prevent it reestablishing.
Or are there other considerations? 


Because my garden is underneath a street light, I like to weed at night.
Farmers take advantage of messing with their dirt at night because the weeds in their soil that are turned over are less likely to germinate. 
Here are some other advantages.

Less mosquitoes than at dusk.
You can meet the toads who roam your garden at night.
No sunburn.

Lettuce likes cool weather and lots of moisture, but there is no reason why you shouldn't sow or plant it out when the weather is hot. Provided you give it the proper, weed-free spacing  and keep it well-watered, it is unlikely to bolt, even when the temperature is high. That said, if you are planting out seedlings, it is probably better to do so in cool, preferably cloudy weather, or in the evening, to prevent wilting; it helps if you can give them some sort of makeshift shade for a few days. I grow mine in light, dappled shade, and find that they taste best when grown as fast as possible - they therefore need plenty of food and water.

Lettuce gets bitter when it bolts. See Robert Cartaino's answer  for why this happens. If you're going to pick baby greens you'll probably be able to harvest while it is still tasty.
Give your lettuce a little shade in hot weather to avoid wilting, and make sure it gets enough water.
If you're not bent on lettuce and just looking for some greens, consider chard or New Zealand spinach. Chard does well for me in hot weather; picked at baby size it is a fine replacement for lettuce. I haven't done NZ spinach, but references I have read recommend it as a green for hot summers.

Various sources will say that cool weather is favoured for a sweet, tender lettuce crop (here's an example), and you will read that germination is poor in hot weather.
However I've never had a problem with germination or flavour in my lettuces sown all through June and July. Even in a greenhouse I always get good germination with radicchio at the height of summer. Though that is naturally a mediterranean plant of course.

Do I need to buy a specialty bark medium designed for orchids or can I use bark from the cedar trees in front of my house?

You can buy small bags of orchid bark at most garden centers.  I'm not sure it would like the cedar (due to the chemistry of cedar) unless the bark is well-weathered.

Voles are tiny, so I'm sure they're coming through any fence you have.

You could then lay that along the base of the fence, and bury it. I don't know how far they dig down, but 6in or a foot might be deep enough?
I've never really thought of voles or shrews as being pests but it looks like they are in the more temperate parts of the US. YouTube has a number of vole-hunting videos!

547,"Is it bad to water plants after the sun has gone down or near dusk?  If so, why?


An advantage is that you can conserve water because of less evaporation -- there's no sunshine.
A major disadvantage is the flip side: the sunshine can't help dry out plant leaves that get wet. Some plants don't like cold and wet foliage. These conditions can foster blight on tomatoes for example. See also this answer that mentions being careful not to leave basil damp overnight.
So if you're watering in the evening, don't spray the foliage. Use a soaker hose or other irrigation technique that targets the roots instead of the foliage.
Early morning is a good time to water. You can give the soil a good soaking and everything has a chance to penetrate before being burned off by the sun. Anything that gets on the foliage will dry up with the sun and you're less prone to disease and fungi.
"
548,"Is it bad to water plants after the sun has gone down or near dusk?  If so, why?


Here in the American South, in the summer, it's actually better to water plants in the evening, so that the water has a chance to soak in before it evaporates.   
"
549,"Is it bad to water plants after the sun has gone down or near dusk?  If so, why?


If anything, the opposite is true. There are two reasons:
First is evaporation. During the day it is hot and the water evaporates quickly - i.e. it is effectively wasted. This is why cities and water authorities have recommendations, regulations, and by-laws controlling when you can use landscape irrigation systems.
Secondly, water on plants in the sun can cause scorching - regardless of your latitude. This is because the water droplets act like small lenses, concentrating the sun. So you really want the water to be off the plants when the sun is out. This usually makes the evening at sunset (or after) more favorable to early morning watering. Of course drip irrigation is another way of avoiding this problem.

550,"In my square foot garden, I have a trellis beside one edge.  Am I being too ambitious to try to put a square for pumpkins, then an empty square, then a square for watermelon along the edge?


Don't underestimate how much watermelons and the like spread. I've tried growing small pumpkins and mini watermelons before, and they can vine out easily many feet. I've never tried growing them up anything like a trellis, but my sense is that even small pumpkins might be too heavy for much upward growth without potential breakage of the vines. I had a wire fence around the edge of my garden, and I don't remember them growing very far up it, so I would expect them to grow more outward than upward.
In short, give them a wide berth (honestly, probably at least 2-3 empty squares between them) or be prepared to chop away at them to keep them from tangling up with each other and overtaking any other plants.
"
552,"Is it bad to water plants after the sun has gone down or near dusk?  If so, why?


It is true that watering when the sun is out can cause scorching; on the other hand, although evening watering reduces evaporation, it leaves plants and the surrounding soil wet, or at least damp, at nightfall; besides providing fertile ground for diseases, this attracts more pests, particularly *slugs.*

553,"While weeding my garden I found a bunch of ant nests (red ants and small black ants).  My first inclination was to destroy the nest and send them packing, but I didn't know if they might aerate the soil, or keep worse pests at bay. Are they of any benefit to the garden?


In my areas of knowledge (Seattle and London), the ants don't make a real difference one way or the other.  They won't damage your plants, nor will they give them much help.  Of course, I can only speak to the small black ants, but as far as I know even the larger, more aggressive ants are more of a threat to the gardener to the garden.  My sister lives in North Carolina and has to deal with fire ants, but she has to attack them because of the danger they pose from biting humans, so they're dealt with long before they could do anything to her garden.
I generally would take a live and let live approach.  As long as they're not overrunning your garden or biting you when you're gardening, they aren't going to be a serious issue, and there will likely be much more damaging bugs to focus your time an energy upon.

I understand why we do this, and think I know approximately what I should be doing, but I'm a complete novice and have never tried to do this before, and would rather not accidentally kill them early on.
So, exactly how do I pinch out a pepper plant?


I assume this is to stop it getting too big? I've grown a lot of peppers and I've never pinched them out, but I grow mine outside.
I find a healthy pepper plant with a good root system will readily put out new shoots from lower down as it gets bigger or is under attack - e.g. broken branch; defoliation by horn worm; falling over and gravity is suddenly in the wrong direction; etc.
So I think you should be fine with whatever you do. 30-40cm sounds a reasonable size and it should be mature enough to do put out new growth quite quickly. Two days ago I staked up some ancho plants about that size that had fallen over, and they were already putting out new shoots after less than a week in that condition.

556,"I've noticed fire ants crawling on my okra plants, particularly where new okra are starting to grow. However, the okra does not seem to be harmed. Is this something I should be concerned about?


As I said in my answer to another question, there's likely more of a risk to a human being bit, especially someone who disturbs the nest, than any risk to the plant.  Fire ants are omnivorous and eat plants as well as other insects (which could be either a positive or a negative, depending on if they're attacking insects that are beneficial or damaging to your plants), but they're probably always going to be less of a risk to your plant than other insect/fungal/viral threats, and it's definitely going to be more of a risk to the gardener than the garden.

557,"My grandparents used to spread the ash from the fireplace on the vegetable plot. This was in reasonably large quantities (I mean, not just a thin trail of ash to deter slugs), and was done to ""add"" to the soil. Visually, it was an eyesore, but they didn't worry about that. 
I am sure I've read elsewhere that this practice is without value, and in fact I dump our fireplace ash out for the bin men. But every time I do it I wonder whether I should be using it in the garden. And it's free, and I have to cart it straight past the veg anyway, to get to the dustbins.
So, is it useful to add ashes as a kind of fertilizer? 
Edit We are mostly burning firewood, sometimes with a small amount of Taybrite


I think there's a big ""depends"". There can be useful minerals in ash, and fly-ash (i.e. commercial coal burning) is sometimes used in agriculture and landscaping. Coal definitely has lots of non-combustable minerals, but it can also contain some nasties - so I'm not sure what the agriculture people do.
I would NOT use charcoal briquette ash (e.g. as used on grills). These definitely contain some nasty things in them - as do the unburnt briquettes, and the whole briquette manufacturing process is notorious for dioxins.
So in comparison, wood ash is quite benign but I can't think of any minerals that would be present and survive burning. I have seen wood ash being dug into a heavy clay soil to break it up. That was quite effective, but that was for texture rather than fertilizer.
"
559,"How often should I fertilize my lawn? Should I follow a certain schedule? I have heard of people fertilizing on around holidays [US: Easter (sometime in April), Memorial day (last week of May), fourth of July, Labor day (first week of September)].  


My decades ago hort 101 class said fertilizer is not really necessary if you use a mulching mower.  If you bag the clippings or if you want thicker greener lawn you can apply fertilizer up to 3 times per year.  The applications should be timed to catch the grass growing but not the weeds.
Here in central Iowa with bluegrass/ryegrass/fescue lawns the grasses go brown/dormant during the hot part of the summer (July, August) and grow most vigorously in the cooler spring and fall.  The weeds go nuts in the spring (April, May, June) - we do not want to encourage that!  So the fertilization schedule works out to once in the first 1-2 weeks in September, again 2-3 weeks after that and (very optionally!) once in the early spring just after the ground thaws (first 1-2 weeks in April).

Wood ash from hardwoods is a useful garden soil amendment, in reasonable quantities. Don't use coal ash or other sources. Be aware of what was burned: I wouldn't want ash that has anything left over from burned plastics or stuff like that.
Ash has a very high pH, and can be useful for helping to raise the pH of acid soil. I use all the ash from my wood boiler both on my lawn and in my garden. (We have very acid native soil.)
It also has (varying depending on the woods that were burned) quite a few nutrients -- which makes sense, since it comes from a plant that consumed lots of nutrients while it was growing. In particular, it is a good source of Calcium and Potassium as well as several micronutrients.
Just don't overdo it, you can raise your pH too far.
"
563,"To prevent root disturbance when planting out, I usually sow my sweet corn in peat pots which I then put in the propagator. As soon as the seed germinates, I grow the seedlings on for two to three weeks and, once they are reasonably robust and have hardened off, I plant them out in the pots. This year, I ran out of peat pots and used plastic ones (same size) instead, and the seedlings seemed bigger and stronger than usual. They are now in the open ground and thriving, despite the slight root disturbance they suffered when I removed them from their pots. Is this year's improvement in the seedlings' growth attributable to the quality of the seed (I used a new brand), or do peat pots, perhaps, slow down their development; and are the problems associated with root disturbance a bit of a myth? I would be interested to know if anyone else has had a similar experience.


Three important things about peat pots (and paper pots) to prevent them from hurting your seedlings:

If the roots aren't burgeoning through the bottom, tear it off
Tear a line down the side of the pot to let the soil expand in the pot when you water it.
Bury the sides of the peat pot or tear them off, exposed sides will absorb water out of the soil and rob it from your plants.

(I read this somewhere this year, I'll give credit if I can find the source)
Nothing will grow very tall with a root ball all clumped and it might have taken longer for your seedlings to burst forth.

564,"I have some hosta plants that are getting quite large and are crowded where they are located right now. What do I need to worry about when moving/splitting hostas?


Don't know if this is the best technique but here is what I did and it worked :)
Go all around the clump pushing in a shovel as far as it will go.  You should now be able to pry/lift the plant out of the hole with the root/dirt ball intact.  Work the shovel down between the plant stems to slice/pry them apart trying to keep as many of the roots attached to their stems as possible.  I divided the root ball into quarters leaving a generous clump (5-10) of stems with lots of roots still attached for planting.

When I put in artichokes, the little black ants decided to 'farm' aphids on them, which really did a number on the young plants.  If they aren't doing that, then maybe you don't have to worry about them.

If the tops of the peat pots stick out above ground level, they have a tendency to wick water up and out of the soil. This will hurt the plants by drying them out, especially where the roots are breaking through the pots.

The ants will feed aphids! When you see aphids it would be too late to save your plants, especially herbs. My suggestion is to use ant bait to kill them. Just place the toxic bait in their daily path.
A few years ago, my home had ants appearing from time to time and they were so annoying. I used an ant bait, mixed with bread and sugar, to attract them. After a few months, they just disappeared.

Now it seems to be recovering, however, instead of leaves growing on the higher existing branches which are leafless, it started growing new green branches with leaves near the root.
Is there anything I can do to stimulate it to grow leaves on the old branches?


The rule with trees and bushes is to trim low to make it grow up, trim high to make it grow out. I suspect pruning the bottom of your ficus would encourage it to grow up.

Other than or in addition to pulling it meticulously, what's the best strategy to remove grass from my flower bed and then keep it from coming back?


Unfortunately, the only effective means I've found of removing it without damaging nearby plants is pulling it up by hand.  If it's so overgrown that the roots are intertwined this can be almost impossible.  You didn't specify what kind of grass, but from my experience, Bermuda grass is very invasive and will spread like crazy...especially if you have some well tilled flower beds with good soil for it to spread into.  Bermuda grass is hard to kill even with Roundup.  If you are able to get it out, the best control method is prevention.

Well, one good way to kill your lawn is to mow it extraordinarily low.  The same principle can be applied in a garden to grass or any other weed with garden shears.
If you pester it enough, it may decide to stop growing. 
The other option is more mulch.
"
590,"The last few years I've had success growing romaine and other leaf lettuces. I usually try to harvest only as much as we need for a day (or couple days). That often means just a few leaves at a time Is it best to cut the leaves as close to the ground as possible and, if you do, is there any chance that those leaves will regrow?
Also, if I'm only taking a few leaves from a bigger plant is it best to take them evenly from the perimeter and slowly work inwards? Or better to do one section inwards so you get a mix of inner and outer leaves?
In short, what's the best way to harvest lettuce to insure maximum yield and the best taste?


If you only want a few leaves, it's easiest to harvest the outer leaves. There's no botanical advantage one way or the other; It's just easier.
But old growth starts to get tough and bitter. It's better to keep harvesting (and re-harvesting) while the leaves are still small and tender.
That's why it is actually best to just grab the top of whatever portion you want to eat and lop it off like you're cutting the grass. Leave at least an inch or so above the growing crown near the roots and it will keep growing back. That way you are always getting new growth rather than the oldest leaves you were picking one at a time.
Repeat that process until your lettuce starts to get bitter.

Mulch
There are many different ways to mulch.
I would put down several layers of newspaper. You will have to rip up the newspaper as required to get it to fit around the existing plants. Cover over any undesired plants. Then give the newspaper a good soaking to keep it in place.
Then cover over with a thick layer of compost. As this breaks down it will enrich the soil.
Then cover with straw, pineneedles, wood chips or whatever else looks good.

What should I do to encourage the growth of a ""fat"" bulb in order to have a better harvest? Does it help to cut it from time to time?


Florence fennel is very fussy and prone to bolting when temperatures are variable, so it could be bolting if you're sowing/planting it new each year. In this case, I suggest trying to protect it from temperature extremes. If you've been growing fennel in the same position year upon year, it could be that the soil needs enriching. Also, it's a biennial, so it's unlikely to produce sufficiently inflated stems after its first year.

I know this may not be the answer you're looking for but your best hope might be to try and persuade your wife. What I mean is, a rustic fence can be an attractive addition to a kitchen garden and aesthetically quite beautiful.
Certainly I can see that you both might not want a perimeter fence around the entire property but a low fence around the vegetable portion only, would work.
When we were in the Tirol in Austria last year we went to an outdoor museum showing the traditional barn-style housing people used to live in over there. The kitchen garden plots had small picket fences round them (presumably to keep the family pigs and hens from entering).

My garden is positioned between a makeshift greyhound track and a semi busy county road.  I've never had a problem with anything eating my plants. My garden is also underneath a streetlight, which might help as well.  
Eggplant, peppers, chives, oregano and tomatoes probably aren't going to be eaten by rabbits, I don't know about deer.  Broccoli and Cucumbers might.   
There are traditional methods like planting a border of marigolds or hanging shiny pie plates, but I'd say the best way to scare animals away is to place your garden in a more public place, hopefully your wife doesn't mind!

Everything is compostable, even you! You're right, you ought to chop them up before trying to compost them, you also need to add some dirt and maybe grass clippings to your compost in order to convert the leaves into compost.
I'm pretty sure dried oak leaves do not offer a lot of nutrients to your compost, but another thing you could do after chopping them up is till them into your soil or use them for mulch, if they never break down, that's actually a good thing!

If it is in fact poison ivy (I'm not sure, from that picture), Roundup or a similar herbicide is usually very effective for killing it. Be careful if you spray something on it, though - Roundup is very toxic to desirable plants as well. Spray on a relatively windless day, and I'd suggest wearing long sleeves, pants, and gloves to minimize skin contact.
Be sure that the remains of the plants are not burned! That can disperse the oils from the plants in the air, and can result in nearby people getting a rash in their nose, throat, and even lungs.

I've made a special pile for leaves. It's helpful to contain it, at least at first, to prevent them from blowing away and making a mess. I just took a length of wire fence and turned it on itself to make a circular ""pen"" for the leaves.
It takes them much longer to break down than regular compost (at least a year, probably two), but the end result is leaf mold, which is a low-fertility soil improver. You can mix this into your garden beds to improve the soil structure and add organic matter without adding a lot of nutrients. Earthworms love leaf piles; when I turned a big pile (1/2 sq yd or so) into my garden this spring I imported tons of worms along with it. The chopping that you're doing will help the process along.

Anyway, I had the idea to grow them all as micro beetroots. Can I pull them out at any time?  What sort of size am I looking for?


Well, I'll send out an answer since I've been thinning my beets pretty regularly and eating the greens.  I planted a 10 foot row of beets about an inch or two apart and thinned down to 3 inches between beet plants.  The plants are about 8 inches tall right now.  I think those would be what you'd consider 'micro beetroots' and they're nice and tender and tasty and you can eat 'em in a salad, but I wouldn't much bother with the root, it's just a sliver.
One thing about beets (and turnips etc..) is that you can harvest the greens like you would with salad without dramatically hurting your crop of beets.  That way you get the best of both worlds.  Now, if you really hate beets, but love the greens (like me) then I'd plant a windowbox about an inch apart, cover with 1/4 inch of soil and that'd be a pretty nice looking edible windowbox...

633,"I know that they come from different sources, but is there a reason to prefer one over the other?  Are they appropriate for different tasks?


Although high in nutrients, because sheep manure is deposited in the fields, it is not mixed with straw or hay like horse or cow manure, and is therefore not as good a soil conditioner. It is also rather dry and takes longer to break down and release its nutrients. However, it has a much lower odour than either cattle or chicken manure and, as pointed out, is easier to handle.
My own soil is very light and free-draining - too light, in fact, because it dries out very quickly, requiring a lot of watering and fertilizing, and it loses nutrients much faster than a heavier soil. Having tried horse, chicken and cattle manure, I have found that the best manure for this type of soil is cattle manure, as it bulks it up and gives it more substance.
Horse and chicken manure - and, probably, sheep manure - are more suitable for lightening heavy, clayey soils.

Things that are bad for seeds in storage are:

heat
light
moisture

If the plastic containers are airtight and you are going to store them in a cool, dark, dry place, then it should be ok.
The best thing to do would be to ensure that they are thoroughly dry first -- you can use a desiccant like silica gel in the container. But if you plan to use the seeds soon, and they were properly dried before they were given to you, and the bags they are in haven't gotten damp/humid, then you may be ok.

By the way, I noticed in my research that the flowers of chives are edible.  So when I get home, at least one flower will get pinched off!


Growing like crazy is a good way to put it.  When you pinch off the plant concentrates more of its magical growing potential into the roots, and hence you have a lot more chives next year.
That being said, it certainly won't be the only reason they take over your entire garden.  I don't think chives will last very long after flowering regardless of whether you pinch them off or not though.

Is it feasible to harvest an appreciable amount of sweet potato from the pot? Or would it only be feasible to grow sweet potatoes in a more traditional vegetable garden?


The growth that you are seeing is normal for sweet potatoes. But what you want is sweet potatoes, not vines. The container that you are using is too small for any significant growth of roots. You may get a couple tiny potatoes.
Of course growing in the ground will work much better.
However you can certainly grow them in a container. Try a five gallon (minimum) plastic bucket, like the ones that hold paint with the handle. This will give the plants room to develop some sweet potatoes. The bigger the container the more root growth.
Go to Gardening Directions and follow the directions for planting tomatoes in a five gallon bucket.

But we also appreciate chives for their taste and answers to other questions indicate that pinching the flowers is advised for herbs to prevent them from maturing.  Is this true of chives as well?
By the way, I noticed in my research that the flowers of chives are edible.  So when I get home, at least one flower will get pinched off!


I always leave my chives to flower and only dead-head later - the flowers are very popular with bees!  I've never noticed any change in flavour or growth. Chives should last - and spread - for many years after planting unless they really dislike where they're planted or you have extremely severe winter freezing.

651,"My grandparents used to spread the ash from the fireplace on the vegetable plot. This was in reasonably large quantities (I mean, not just a thin trail of ash to deter slugs), and was done to ""add"" to the soil. Visually, it was an eyesore, but they didn't worry about that. 
I am sure I've read elsewhere that this practice is without value, and in fact I dump our fireplace ash out for the bin men. But every time I do it I wonder whether I should be using it in the garden. And it's free, and I have to cart it straight past the veg anyway, to get to the dustbins.
So, is it useful to add ashes as a kind of fertilizer?

When talking about plants / gardens in general minerals are just a composition of nutrients that plants get from the soil they are placed into.  So yes in this case they are the same thing.  In a different context they may mean something different but in this case they represent the same thing.

653,"I recently bought a house, and would like to keep my lawn looking as nice as everyone else's in my neighborhood. Right now I water every zone 5-8 minutes, every other day. This is just something I made up, and is not based on anything. However, as the picture shows, my lawn is starting to die. 
I assume I should water more in the zones that get full sun, but I'd like to make sure before I start a new schedule.
So, for how long should I water each zone? 
The white is sun, and the gray is shaded by my tree. I live in Fort Worth, TX and have bermuda grass.



It's normal that wherever the sun hits most the grass is usually going to die a lot faster.
And unless you are ready for some pretty hefty water bills there is not much you can do about it besides water.
Aeration / dethatching may also help as it breaks up the ground and gets rid of all the dead grass beneath the good grass.  Aeration will put in those holes or spikes into the grass allowing more water / fertilizer to enter the grass and help air it out.
If you are not concerned about your water bill and you want to keep up with the jones' :) then set the zones of the dying grass area to 12-15 minutes.  It may / may not help..the sun is a very strong animal.  The only other thing you can do as mentioned is to aerate or dethatch.
Good luck

Some minerals are nutrients.  Nutrients are not necessarily minerals.   There are amino acids that are also nutrients (think vitamins and minerals in your diet).

655,"We have a raised bed garden that does well for the most part.  For aesthetic purposes, my wife will not let me put a fence around the garden.  Most of the veggies and herbs do well and do not get eaten by the various critters.  But sometimes they do, especially the peppers and cucumbers.  I have seen deer eating the garden, but there could be others as well i suppose.  We live along the edge of deep woods in the country (NE Ohio).
What are some good techniques to keep them away?  I do not care too much about being earthy, so pesticides are an option if there are no other alternatives. 
Things in there this year are: basil, oregano, chives, peppers (bell, jalapeno, banana), broccoli, eggplant, cucumbers, and tomatoes.



I constructed a couple of cages out of chickenwire and 2x2s that's about 18 inches tall, with a chickenwire roof, as well (construction is described in ""Square Foot Gardening"" by Mel Bartholomew). I keep my spring salad mix covered with one, and also use one to cover my tomatoes and peppers until they're large enough to handle some minor mammal munching.   Once everything is big enough to handle some grazing, I remove the cages.

I've got three varieties and the Black Plum is not curling, but the Cherokee Purple and the Sweet Tangerine are. The Black Plum is planted a short distance from the other two.



Tomato leaves curl naturally if it's too dry, too hot, too humid or too windy. In other words, the leaves will tend to curl if growing conditions are not optimum for the plant.

Mind you, leaves will also curl for other reasons too, such as disease.  From the sounds of it your environment has just been unstable recently.  I would not be too worried yet.

Just to echo something @JonH has touched on: I live in nearby Irving and I just let it go.
Our lawns are a bit of a mix, but the bermudagrass is actually one of the better looking bits when it yellows.
As well as huge water savings, here are some other advantages:

It doesn't look that untidy - in fact yellow bermuda looks a lot tidier than the ""haven't had time for two weeks to mow it"" look
It doesn't need cutting on a weekly basis. In the Texas Summer Heat? No thanks! I cut ours for the last time this week - next time will probably be September.
Keeping up with the Jones'? They're simply not worth it. If you have a dictatorial housing association, then you need to educate them about xeriscaping.  (it is no accident that our new succulent/cacti bed takes a large chunk out of our front lawn)

670,"I have a flower bed with some ground cover, daffodils, tulips and a few shrubs. Lately grass has been growing pretty much everywhere, including through the ground cover.
I tried an herbicide called ""Over the Top"" which is supposed to kill grass without harming other plants, but its effects were pretty negligible.
Other than or in addition to pulling it meticulously, what's the best strategy to remove grass from my flower bed and then keep it from coming back?


I saw an episode of Ask This Old House where they were trying to remove long grasses that had grown into juniper shrubs.
Their solution was to use glyphosate (Roundup) to kill the grass, and then to add a steel edging barrier to prevent the grasses from spreading back to where they had removed them.
Glyphosate will kill any vegetation it comes in contact with, so they had the novel idea to use a paint brush to actually paint all the stalks they wanted to remove so as to not coat the existing juniper shrubs. They'd mentioned it may take a couple applications to kill all the grass.
Be sure not to do this on a windy day or some of the glyphosate may still come in contact with plants you'd like to keep.

I don't know if it will cause serious harm to the plant, but it will make it an uneven shape. perhaps enough for it to topple over (my outdoor peppers will topple if they're not staked). Outdoors, the fruit can get sunburn scorching with too much direct sun. I'm not sure if the glass will block enough light. If not, then this might become a problem.

Note that there are different kinds of yellow leaf deficiencies. You might be deficient of manganese, magnesium, or iron. An acidic fertilizer is recommended.

You do not say where you live. Since it is a cactus, here is what I would do. I would not place it in a situation where it stands in water. That would kill it because the roots do not like siting in water. If it is not going to be cold I would put it outside in a shady area. The natural moisture (morning dew or rain) would be sufficient to keep it alive and happy for two months or longer. I have mine in full sun to shade and rarely water.

687,"I inherited an established garden in which a very sad-looking peony was struggling to grow right next to (practically from under) a rose.  In the two growing seasons I've been at this house, the peony's few leaves were a yellow-green and it never sent up a flowering shoot.  In May this year I moved the rose that was next to it (due to a color scheme I didn't agree with), and at the same time, I removed the peony. It looks as if the peony managed to grow from a bit of root was left after the previous owner tried to remove it and replace it with some roses, but perhaps it was too deep in the soil, or constantly cut back, or too malnourished to grow successfully. I potted up the bits of root, some with leaf still attached, hoping that I could get at least one plant. I've been keeping the potting compost moist but not water-logged and keeping the pots out of direct sunlight.  Is this the right thing to do to save the peony, or is there a better method? 


Peonies are often shipped by nurseries as root stock, and they can be propagated from toot cuttings (which you've found!), so there are quite a few nursery websites with pages about caring/planting peony root stock. Peonies are apparently also noted for their longevity, so I think you've got a good chance to keeping it going.

It sends these little whitish lateral shoots about 12 inches deep in all directions and thereby spreads under fences and into all the other flowers in the bed.

I think you are going to have a lot of hard work ahead of you! This is true of quite a few invasives.
Here's a general website on invasives that lists quite a few including Houttuynia:

For this general type of spreading, it recommends physical removal and the use of systemic herbicide to kill all root parts. It notes that the rhizomes for Houttuynia are notorious for getting embedded within other root systems.
I don't know if it flowers, but also decapitate flower heads before they seed.

689,"I've always heard not to water your lawn during the day and that the fine water droplets will evaporate before it is absorbed by the lawn (either in the air or while sitting above ground).  But how bad is it?  Is there a direct correlation to the temperature outside?


The answer to the question is do not water your lawn during the heat of midday. Watering at night will eventually lead to fungi on your lawn. The best time to water your lawn is in the early morning between 4 and 8 am. It has time to soak into the soil and does the lawn well. Watering at midday is wasting water. It evaporates quickly.
Twice a week should be enough. Make sure that you can put a half inch of water on your lawn each time you water. Put out a rain meter to measure the amount of water.

The porous clay watering systems that I've seen include an attachment that you use for a drinking bottle to automatically fill, so I'm not positive these are the same that you're referring to.  However, this will release quite a bit of water for a cactus and wouldn't last for 2 months (mine is usually empty after a week, so my fast drinking plant can last about 2 weeks without me).
A simple DIY solution is to place one container of water above the plant and leave a piece of string or fabric running from the container down to the cactus.  The string will slowly wick the water down.
There are also electronic systems that may give you more control, though they are expensive (e.g. this one over on Amazon.
No matter which solution you use, test it long before you leave so you can be sure there are no leaks, and should it over waters things, you're around to stop it.

They are in sealed paper bags, but they occupy a lot of space and I was thinking about opening the bags and putting the seeds into small transparent plastic containers. Is this a good way to store and not compromise them? If not, what is the preferred alternative? 


Keeping them in the paper bags lets you be able to write the name/variety of them on the bag. 
Long term storage of most vegetable and grains seeds would be to put them into a cool and dry environment. And longer storage happens when oxygen is removed from the container. This is why grains for long term storage will have air replaced with pure nitrogen.

697,"I'm using an organic liquid fish fertilizer (3-3-0). The instructions say to dilute 1 Tablespoon in a gallon of water, every two weeks for vegetables. But it isn't clear how many plants this will feed.
This will depend on how much my plants really need, but I'm looking for a ballpark -- wondering if I'm spreading it too thinly. Is a 1 gallon feeding good for:

2 cabbages, or
20 cabbages, or
50 cabbages?

Not that I have 50 cabbages... just want a benchmark application rate.
(For anyone reading my other question about nutrient imbalance, this application is to a newer garden with very different soil analysis.)


After asking the question I was thinking about it more. It seems obvious now.
The fertilizer is 3% nitrogen, 3% phosphorus.
It calls for a tablespoon in a gallon of water. That's about 0.004 gallons of fertilizer. Assuming for simplicity that the fish fertilizer has the same density as water, 8.35 lb/gal, that's 0.033 pounds of fertilizer, or 0.001 pounds of nitrogen.
If my soil test called for 2 pounds of nitrogen per 1000 sq ft (for the season), that's 0.002 lbs per sq ft.
If I apply every two weeks as marked on the package over my growing season that's about 7 applications. So over the course of the season that feeds about 3.5 sq ft of garden, give or take.
So it looks like the answer is that a gallon of diluted fertilizer is about enough to feed 1-2 cabbages for two weeks.

If your plant is not special plant such as carnivorous plant, any water from the tap is okay.
The fact is tap water may contain different things such as chlorine, and a lot of different minerals. My plant is drinking water with chlorine day to day, but they are thriving.
In the end, rain water maybe good, but who knows what is inside the water because the contamination from human activities such as car driving and industrial plant releasing exhaust fume from the chimney. Check this link, and this too. You may want to have your own judgement.
I think rain water and tap water are both okay in some extent, on the other hand, distilled water is not really that good because most of the minerals are lost. I prefer tap water ,it is cleaner because chlorine kills bacteria.

In future, you could use a tomato cage to support your flowers.  Place the cage before your peony starts putting out new growth in the spring and as the stems elongate, pull the leaves and flower stems through the gaps to make it look natural. You can also buy peony 'cones' (google it) which look a lot like tomato cages and plant support 'hoops'.

Inspect your flowers before bringing them inside; if you see insects on them, give them a gentle shake or dislodge the critters by hand with something like a small, soft paintbrush. Another option is to cut the flowers in the early morning and let them sit in a bucket of water outside in the shade for a few hours before bringing them inside; the insects will often leave on their own. I've been bringing cut flowers in for years and find this usually works just fine. I wouldn't go to the effort of killing insects that are there naturally.

For several years, I had tried to save money by not having landscapers do the annual evergreen trimming.  I can only assume that this is the source of my problems.
To start, I'm not a big fan of the ""manicured"" evergreen look.  With that in mind, is it possible with proper trimming and/or pruning to limit the growth of trees, shrubs, and hedges, or is it just an accepted reality of landscaping that eventually they'll need to be replaced?


If you're buying all new shrubs and trees, look into varieties that grow very slowly or dwarf varieties of which there are many; these usually need very little pruning and allow your garden to keep a more natural look.

I started the corn and sunflowers first, thinking that they'd get a head start before the beans start to climb.
My question is:
What's the right ratio of beans to corn/sunflower? I.e. how many vines is each plant capable of supporting?


Yummm...black turtle beans. I'd suggest only 1 to 2 bean plants per sunflower so they don't block out too much sun, and since sweetcorn plants have shallow roots, only 1 bean plant per corn, particularly if you get windy weather in the summer.  I remember my parents' sweetcorn crop in SE Pennsylvania - with no beans adding weight to the corn - suffering damage from windy summer storms on an annual basis. You also don't want to hamper the pollination of your corn crop too much.

732,"I bought a Aloe Vera in a shop a year ago and I just use the pot that came with it, so obviously I don't know what is in the soil and their components.
Yesterday I felt that I should transplant the aloe because the plastic pot is broken and the soil should be aerated. So I took out the aloe and quickly found that the soil are mostly clay, stone and soil. The clay are so dry that they look like stone. This kind of soil is bad and I want to completely change the soil, however, the aloe has its roots holding on the soil.
Can we remove all of the soil from the root? If I remove the soil, the root cannot hold on the new soil immediately because the contact of the root with the new soil is no better than the case that the root hold on the soil by itself like a web.
Do you have experience of such transplant and come with no harm to the plant? If the root cannot hold on the soil, the plant will topple.


In my experiences with all varieties of aloe the one thing that they all have in common is there resilience. In the past couple of months I had been moving all of my plants to another location. One of the pots with aloe had broke and the plant was laying on the ground bare rooted. I have so many plants that I just left it where it was on the ground. Two months later I came across it still in the same spot and it is just as alive as when it was in the pot.

In addition, your container is too shallow for most plants. It can only be used as container for plant germination.

Anyway, I mostly put all my grass clippings (primary offended of volume of material) as well as leaves and other material. I just started doing this because I didn't think it would be good to have the local rubbish company haul this off.
As of late, the pile has started getting a bit bigger than I want it to, and it exudes a sickly sweet smell.  What can I do to speed up the decomposition of all this vegetation?  I don't mind the smell that much, since it's pretty far from the house.  However, will any process I initiate cause any other odours to come from it that may be more noticeable than the current smell?
I'm not after dirt, just trying to lessen my impact a bit (and stop that smell).
Will some of those organic disintegration agents work (like a stump dissolver)?


Bad smelling compost is usually a sign of too much nitrogen material in your compost.  If you have too much nitrogen in your compost it will start to generate ammonia.  You need a balance of 1 part nitrogen to 30 parts carbon based material to have a good compost pile.  Your grass clippings are a source of nitrogen and are probably the main problem.  It's not a big deal if you can balance it with enough carbon based material.  Dried leaves, wood chips, straw, and shredded newspaper are a good source of carbon.

If you cut off the head (central spear) when the flower shoots are well developed, but before the tiny flower buds have opened, the plant will not grow another one, but will produce side shoots which you can pick regularly for five or six weeks; however, if you let any of them flower, the plant will stop producing them.
If you choose a sunny site, work enough manure or compost into the soil in autumn and, if necessary, lime (the ideal pH for broccoli is 7.0 - neutral) - better to manure and/or fertilize first, and then wait at least a couple of months before applying the lime - you should get some good-sized heads. Corvet is a very good variety: it produces a large head and, once decapitated, a succession of secondary shoots.

I've been composting for the past few years. In my research, there are a few two main causes (besides the excess nitrogen pointed out by shane): too much moisture and adding things that are not compostable.
You should not add things like dairy products and meat scraps, they might a part of your problem. The solution for moisture is the same for to much nitrogen. Adding dried leaves, wood chips, newspaper can help soak up some of that excess moisture. Also, turn the compost regularly. I turn mine about once a month. 
With that said, you can considerably cut back on the material you are adding by using a mulching lawnmower. Some people say that using a mulching mower is one of the best things you can do for your lawn.

The photo on the left does look like clover, but it could also be wood sorrel (oxalis).  You'll know for sure once it flowers.  Neither one should concern you, really.  Although some people consider them to be unsightly in their lawns, clovers provide nectar for various insect species (especially bees) and some can be quite pretty. Some wood sorrels are considered ornamental so you may want to keep it if it turns out to be oxalis. It looks like it's in a location where it can easily be removed by hand so if you don't want the plant there just dig it up.

The other answers are very correct, but they left out one important aspect, which is to add some dirt to your heap between adding more organic matter.  You've got a lot of surface area to cover, but that grass'll break down to nothing if you keep up on it. 
Also, you probably should break it into more manageable piles by putting partitions in between your huge piles of dead grass.  It would be good to not put new stuff right on top of last years stuff so you can actually get at it if it ever finally breaks down. 3 partitions is probably ideal.  One you add to, one you use and one that is is currently decomposing.

773,"This discussion of seed storage got me wondering if it is feasible to harvest seeds from vegetables (I'm partial to tomatoes) as I cut them up for consumption. 
Generally, I buy seeds each year. But if I have a steady supply, and it's not ill-advised, could I not save seeds for the next year? If so, what steps should I take? Is there a reason not to save vegetable seeds?


In theory yes.  In practice, often no.  A lot of annual vegetable seed that you get are hybrids, which means that they are not genetically stable.  Next years plants will not be as productive as this years, if they are productive at all.  This is especially true of conventional seed, which the seed companies intentionally breed to under perform in future years so you have to keep buying seed.  
It is less true of heirloom plants.  So if you have heirlooms you're more likely to have success with seed saving.

The manure is going to include other nutrients as well nitrogen - there's probably a sufficient spread of nutrient types that depletion is slow or non-existent.
One advantage of your rotation is that your beans are adding nitrogen to the soil in different parts of the garden. You should also be less prone to pests - which it sounds like isn't currently a problem for you and your friends in your area at the moment.

I'm growing asparagus this year for the first time, so I wouldn't classify myself as an expert on this...yet. ;)  However, I do have a stand of apparently healthy asparagus in progress at this moment!
My asparagus was planted ""bare root"".  I'm not sure if you can get it other ways or not.  It took several weeks to start coming up.  We're watering it almost every day, but I don't think this is typically needed.  I live in North Texas and we're in the middle of one of the longest dry spells we've seen in a while, plus temperatures are hitting above 100 on a regular basis.  Asparagus doesn't like it's roots to be kept too wet and can have problems with root rot if kept too wet.
You probably already know this part, but asparagus can take several years to grow enough to actually yield a crop.  It's a big plant too, so allow 1 1/2 to 2 feet between each plant.

Since it is a perennial, you can't fix the soil as easily as annuals once you've planted it.
So now is the time to:

Get your pH right by adding lime or sulfur as needed
Add organic matter so it has time to break down in the soil
Get any perennial weeds in the area to be planted under control

Dumping any food in your garden sounds like a good idea at first, but the pitfall is that we must process the food before using it as a fertilizer. For the food is not decomposted into the simplest form, thus various bugs such as Springtail which eat decaying matter. This is the reason why we need composting instead of dumping the food right in your field.

I'd avoid hot pepper oil as a deterrent in case your kitty gets it in her eyes or mouth - ouch! A safe alternative is something called 'bitter apple' spray which is often available from vets or pet supply shops and will not harm your plants. Vets often suggest it as a deterrent for pets that are chewing or licking inappropriately.
Does your cat have enough 'toys'? It won't completely stop her from nibbling your plants, but if there's something fun to keep her preoccupied, she might bother the plants less often. Bored cats like to make mischief which I know from experience. After my two were given outdoor access, they caused a lot less havoc indoors and leave the house-plants alone. And as Suresh mentioned, it often helps to grow 'cat' grass (you can buy it as seed and it's easy to grow) or even a catnip plant to which your cat can have free access.

This might be an application for ""landscape fabric""? Also known as ""weed fabric"", the big box sellers in the US have it.

The weeds are blocked by the fabric, and the strawberries grow through their holes - or that is the idea.

Is it just something I need to live with, or are there ways to slow the growth of succulents?


What kind of succulent?
If it's like most succulents, you can absolutely just trim the ends off the plant and it will be fine (and, if you wanted, you could plant those and make new plants to keep or give away).
Additionally, many plants will cooperate well with root pruning, like what bonsai growers do. This typically involves taking the plant out of the pot, removing all the soil from the roots so that you can see what you are doing, and removing the largest root or two. The most effective roots are actually the smallest ones, for reasons of surface area. 
However, this is only a general answer, and to be sure that the answer is a good one for your situation, I would absolutely need to know the specific kind of plant.

I find that putting down some sort of mulch will help with keeping weeds down and water in. 
You can certainly buy mulch, but if you happen to have leaves or grasses you recently trimmed (really, anything that is not going to try to grow on you! So no roots, and no succulents), you can put them down around your strawberries. This tends to be easier, in my experience, with recently cut leaves and grasses, simply because they are still pliable. If, however, you have dried out stuff, you can just be sure to layer it more carefully. The only real problem with using this kind of mulch is that it will biodegrade more quickly.
When you have runners, you can always move aside your mulch to allow the runners to root.

829,"Last year I used row covers on PVC frames to effectively keep cabbage worms off my broccoli and cabbage. I put the covers on in spring as soon as I put the seedlings in the ground, and then took them off when the plants were larger. There were some worms in the broccoli when I harvested, but they don't do much damage and come out of the heads with a good soaking when brought inside.
This year I didn't put the covers on early like I should have, and I'm wondering: is worth my time to put covers over more mature plants that already have cabbage worms? Will I just be ""locking the bad bugs in""? What if I first spray with Bt, which seems to have been effective at controlling them so far, and then cover?


I would personally use BT, and then use row covers.
I will note that I have not yet grown anything in that family yet, but from what I found online, these critters have 3-5 overlapping generations (I had a suspicion that this was going to be the case). So BT should kill off the current larva, and covering should prevent additional ones.

831,"I started using fertilizer spikes on my dwarfed citrus trees in small pots.  (Details may be found in this question.)  As suggested, I used half a spike for each pot and I put the spike as far from any roots as possible.

As far as I am aware, fertilizer burn is a result of too much fertilizer causing the water in the plant to be drawn out. This makes leaves look, well, burned. 
In a specific search on citrus trees, it sounds like ""Dark green, lush leaves with burned tips indicate excessive fertilizing"".
I suggest watching to see if the leaves start showing any signs of burned tips, while keeping in mind that this is likely how the leaves would also look if they are under-watered (for the same reason, basically).
The fact that it's half a spike should mean you're fine, I would think.

Carrots often develop forked roots when:

the bed is too firm

If your soil is stony - and this is what usually causes the problem -, you should have better luck with a short-rooted variety such as Amsterdam.

I was going to suggest that you may not be getting cold enough in the winter. (some plants require a cold / dormant period to flower & set fruit).  But your plant is blooming. That is not the problem.

Strawberry beds need to be ""rejuvenated"" every few years.  This means killing or removing  all the plants in one part of the strawberry bed.  The remaining plants will fill in the cleared area by runners.  The usual reason that this is done is because the older plants are much less productive than new runners / plants.
In your case this will also reduce the plant packing and get some air flow through the strawberry bed.  This will help dry out the moisture on the plants and soil.  (Mold likes moist conditions)  If you must water be sure to do in the early morning so that it can all dry out.

No need to plant them all at once, or fill your whole box. Sow in succession, a few plants at a time, every fortnight or so, and by the time the first ones are ready, you can pull them up and plant some more!
The closer you sow, the smaller the plants will be, and you can absolutely harvest them whenever you like. Harvest early for smaller roots, and fresher tasting shoots, and later for larger roots.

Strawberries are especially susceptible to the fungus Botrytis which is probably the cause of the moldy-looking growth you're seeing. Botrytis likes wet and humid conditions. The only way to control its spread is to make sure to remove infected material as soon as you see it; improve air circulation in your patch (make sure plants aren't crowded and thin out old, dead leaves); keep plants in light soil that doesn't stay too damp; and water only in the morning (and only if needed) in such a way that the fruits don't get wet. Some people suggest raising your fruits off the ground with straw, but I keep finding infected fruits on my straw bed because we've had so much wet weather lately.

Let me add what I would do, since I have a couple of vines at home:
At first, just choose some strong ""main"" branches of the grape vine that are healthy, and prune everything else down to 2 or three buds.
These should then regrow a lot (if the plant is healthy) the following year, and if you want the plant to spread then keep the strongest, most vigorous ones to build a structure of strong grape vine trunks, if you know what I mean.
Anything that isn't part of the main structure (the base branches) can and should be cut back every year to promote year-old wood and thus fruit, I think.
It's a lot of work though. If you want them to be ornamental none of this is necessary. :D

So should I wait until next Spring to plant them? If so, how should I keep them?



If you want to try planting them next spring, this article describes storing onion sets. I presume that storage of onion sets requires around the same parameters as storing mature onions:

Don't wash them before storing
Store at 32-40°F
Store in a dark place
Store in a dry place; 65-75% relative humidity
Make sure there's good ventilation
Check them occasionally and remove any that are starting to go bad
Don't store with apples or anything else that gives off ethylene gas

But if you've got enough time for the onions to mature before the end of the growing season, you might be just as well to transplant them and let them get bigger for this year's harvest -- you're more likely to get harvestable onions with less risk of the sets spoiling in storage.

891,"I planted some habanero seeds a week ago. Most of the websites said it need 2 weeks to 3 weeks to germinate. What is the best condition for its germination?
I am in Hong Kong and having a 29 degree Celsius temperature on average. How much water does it need? Water once a day or twice a day?


The most important things the seeds need are warmth and moisture.
What I normally do is put the seeds in-between a few sheets of wet toilet paper on a plate, and then wrap the plate in a plastic bag and tie a knot in it so that the water cant escape via evaporation. Then put the plate somewhere warm, like an airing cupboard.
The seeds usually then start to sprout in a week. After that ill pick all the seeds that have sprouted and plant them in soil.

Also are they practical considering the speed at which they grow? 
How do nettles compare with thorny bushes?


I have nettles growing as weeds on the perimeter of my property and it has never occurred to me to regard them as any kind of security. Even though they are fast growing. Their defects would include:

they die down in the winter
flimsy physical barrier
sting cannot penetrate strong clothing

There are various types of hedge and shrubbery which are hardier in the winter, which can throw up a pretty impenetrable barrier, and whose thorns can do serious damage. 
Blackthorn (which is seriously thorny and dense) and holly come to mind. This RHS page has a longer list.
Side note: my father, as a farmer, used to pull up nettles with his bare hands. It's not a heavily armed plant.

No.  I bought a house this year with existing raised bed gardens.  I found out later that the beds are full of Stinging Nettle seed.  I also have a problem keeping my wife's cat out of my garden.  In an attempt to turn two bad situation into a good situation, I allowed the nettle to grow in all areas not taken up by vegetables in order to keep the cat out.  The nettle does work to keep the cat out but any human sized intruders will just walk right through it with a mildly irritating sting for the rest of the day.  If the intruder happened to have arthritis, they may actually feel better after walking through the nettle.

911,"I was going to ask this as an aside in this question, but I remembered that there are no asides in StackExchange.  
Say I've done this again: 

I go out and I plant two rows of beets, two rows of turnips, two rows of radishes and two rows of carrots. 

Given beets, carrots and radishes like 18 inches between rows and turnips like 24 inches between rows. How close do I plant the first row of turnips to the last row of beets and how close do I plant the last row of turnips to the first row of radishes? 


No experience here, just some simple thinking and math. I would halve the two distances and add them then use that number. Think about the plant needing half of the row spacing on each side. So if it needs 12"" of space then it needs 6"" on each side. If another plant needs 18"" of space then it needs 9"" on each side. Thus if you plant the 12"" and the 18"" in neighboring rows I would use at least 15"" of space between them.

918,"In previous years, I've noticed my tomatoes have root-like buds towards the base of the stem, but haven't wanted to experiment in case I wreck them.
Anybody had any experience of this? Is it worth it?


The hairs on tomato stems will turn into roots, given the right conditions (this makes taking cuttings of tomatoes extremely easy).   If you let them grow along the ground, they'll root in various places where the vine touches dirt and stays reasonably moist.
As long as your compost is well aged, and won't burn the plants, there shouldn't be anything wrong with piling it up near the bases of the tomatoes.   If it's not well aged, the microbes may cause some rotting, though.   I generally prefer to top dress in rings around my plants, rather than pushing it up next to the stems.

920,"I understand that a lawn may need to be dethatched periodically so the roots of the grass can reach into the soil (instead of into the thatch layer).  How do I tell if my thatch layer is getting too thick?  (Preferably before the lawn starts to look bad.)


I'd go by the way it looks - if it looks like there's quite a bit of yellowing, dry, and dead grass then I'd scarify. 
Alternatively, if you don't want to wait until it begins to look bad then periodically just scarify a small patch to see how much thatch is lifted. If there's a lot, the lawn will probably benefit from a good scarification.
This video shows what I mean: Lawn Care & Landscaping : How to De-Thatch a Lawn
A useful side-effect of scarifying by hand is that's also very good exercise!

921,"When thinning seedlings (salads, beetroots, spinach etc) I will normally pull out the entire plant (root included) of the discarded seedlings. Like it's a weed. 
Where my seedlings are densely packed this is nearly impossible to do without disturbing and possibly damaging the remaining ""good"" seedling.
So is it sufficient to just pinch out the discarded seedlings and leave the root system in there? That way I've given the remaining seedlings the space they need above ground. But presumably they also need the room underground too? Will the left over roots make way and/or die off fast enough?
So is decapitation a valid thinning strategy?


I thin my carrots with kitchen scissors. It avoids the problems you describe with disturbing neighboring roots, and the small plants quickly die -- the leftover root systems aren't big enough to cause a problem. It's also an accurate way to do the thinning without having to get my big clumsy hands in amongst the plants.
I should also add that this is a useful strategy for weeding around the same batch of delicate seedlings. It's tedious, but you only need to snip right near the seedlings, and usually only early in the season -- I do it when I'm thinning.

Everywhere that I've seen this discussed has said to cut the seedlings (presumably with some sort of clean scissors) you don't want to keep as close to the soil level as you can. Otherwise you may uproot or at least disturb the seedlings you want to keep. 
I'd never considered the problem of the left-over root system. However, I've noticed that with the seedlings that I have pulled and separated by hand, the root system isn't very large yet at the point of the first thinning. I would expect that this would therefore not be a significant problem.
"
924,"At the base of our old garage where the concrete foundation meets an asphalt slope down to the alley behind, we've had small elm tree saplings grow as weeds over the past three years. I've never managed to pull one out when they are very small, and instead had to clip them down at their bases.  Each year they regrow from the same little stumps, more and thicker new shoots.
Since I cannot dig them out without tearing up the asphalt, how can I permanently kill the roots left there after I've lopped off all the shoots and cut the little stumps down as near to the concrete as possible?
A salesperson at the home center suggested concentrated ground clear, but I wonder if there's something less drastic I can use to target only the sapling stumps. The area is not in proximity of any other plants, lawn, or where children might play.


I don't have personal experience with this. However, when referring to stumps from maples, I have had it suggested to paint roundup onto the stumps. This may require repeated doses. I presume it would work with elms, too.
Since you don't have anything else around, you also don't have to worry about the roundup being in the soil for a while to prevent other plants from growing. This would be why I don't have personal experience, in fact, as there are many plants around the maple saplings in question. 
That would be what I would try, were I in your situation.
And because I like references, this looks useful about halfway down the page.

930,"I have a vine-type plant that is growing on areas of my Jacaranda tree (me + the tree live in Australia). It has little leaves. The roots of the vine grow on the outer-layer of bark on the tree.
Does anyone know what it is and if it will cause any probs over time or hurt the tree in any way?



The plant is a type of orchid. Orchids like to establish themselves on the bark of a tree because they are an epiphytic plant. They like the shade that a tree provides. This plant will in no way harm that huge tree. Most plant lovers would be thrilled to have such a lovely plant given to them for free by nature. 
Good luck with plant.

Slugs love the yeast in beer. Bury a container in the ground where slugs can climb in. Fill it halfway with beer and the slugs will climb in and the alcohol will kill them.
Another way to control slugs and snails in your garden is to spread ashes from the fireplace around the perimeter of the garden. This will deter the pesky critters. Salt spread around the perimeter will also do the job.. I hope that this helps!

938,"I never had indoor plants before. Are there disadvantages to having indoor plants in a dusty environment?
If the plant is a creeper, is there a way that I can clean its leaves? Probably by spraying water on the whole plant, but that might spoil the walls! 
Whenever we have to put water in the flowerpots are we supposed to take it out of house every time?


Creepers could be a problem if you are trying to grow one without support and not in a hanging basket, as they would get untidy/cover the item they are sitting on.
Oh, just saw your question about watering.
I don't think that people typically move plants outside to water them. Myself, I have a drain tray (cannot remember the precise term) below all of my indoor plants. This allows me to water so as to allow some water to exit the bottom without immediately soaking the surface it's on. Other people I know will bring their plants - usually the large tree-type ones - into the bath to water them.
You just want to make sure that your plants are not sitting in the water that drained out of them. There are exceptions to this, as there are plants that prefer to be quite wet, but it's generally a good to to keep an eye on. You will otherwise risk root rot.

942,"Recently I noticed the following cracks and small holes on the bottom side of my better boy tomoato plants.  I am in Maryland and we have not had a lot of rain the past month however I regularly try to ensure they get about 1"" water a week from a soaker hose setup.  What could be causing this?  Is it due to a fluctuation in water levels somehow?  Note that I'm growing four other types of tomato (brandy boy, porterhouse, grape, and an early season hybrid) and this is the only one that is having the issue.



Having read something about this problem before, I did a bit of hunting. I do not (yet) have personal experience with this, but considering the weather can certainly believe that I will!
In looking at your photo, it's unclear if it's insect holes, black leathery patches that are characteristic of blossom end rot, or a hole that is a result of a cave-in from blossom end rot. 
I'm leaning toward blossom end rot, which is a problem with insufficient calcium for the rapidly developing fruit. As I understand, it could be a result of unstable soil moisture levels.

Save the beer and make your own traps is my suggestion. It works just as well and is a lot cheaper.
Mix the following and let it sit in a warm place, stirring occasionally until you get a yeasty smell.
1 cup of water
1 teaspoon of sugar
1 teaspoon of flour
1/2 teaspoon of dry yeast
Place it in marjarine containers, pop bottles etc, every 15 feet or so in your garden. It's worked quite well for me. Good luck

946,"We have a raised bed garden that does well for the most part.  For aesthetic purposes, my wife will not let me put a fence around the garden.  Most of the veggies and herbs do well and do not get eaten by the various critters.  But sometimes they do, especially the peppers and cucumbers.  I have seen deer eating the garden, but there could be others as well i suppose.  We live along the edge of deep woods in the country (NE Ohio).
What are some good techniques to keep them away?  I do not care too much about being earthy, so pesticides are an option if there are no other alternatives. 
Things in there this year are: basil, oregano, chives, peppers (bell, jalapeno, banana), broccoli, eggplant, cucumbers, and tomatoes.



Try the plant rue as a border plant. It is a deterrent against deer and rabbits. From what I know, you'd need a lot of it growing around, so I'd say a solid line or two around your garden would be best. It doesn't grow very tall or wide though so it doesn't take up that much space.

I also agree with the Hugelkulture beds mentioned above. You can just place all the branches and logs in a pile or several piles and put everything that you want to compost over top of them and then cover with either soil or invertred sod and mulch.
If you cover with soil you can plant in it right away. I have made several hugel beds in my gardens and they have all done wonderfully. As the wood rots it feeds the soil and holds moisture.

967,"Our lupines (also called lupin in the UK) were done flowering for the year and were harboring an aphid infestation, so I mowed them. Are the ""stumps"" likely to regrow next year or do the plants rely on gathering a lot of energy through the foliage to survive the winter?
(They were originally weeds scavenged from a roadside that we multiplied here over a couple of years, so it's not a major loss if they won't regrow.)


It's hard to tell off-hand if they'll regrow or not, as it depends on a lot of factors such as how low did you mow it, how much damage have the aphids caused, how well developed is the root system, how bad is the winter, etc.
Usually, plants need to ""prepare"" for the winter by shutting down their flower/fruit production and stockpiling energy, and taking steps to reduce their energy consumption. Given that the plant has not had much chance to do any of this, I wouldn't necessarily bet my money on it. However, since there is some more time till winter, perhaps it might work out too.

One would expect that the producers of the seed potatoes are going to be better about keeping their product disease free than your average supermarket, but there are no guarantees in life.  As to your chances of getting a bad, disease carrying potato from your supermarket, I'd say that depends on how well you trust that supermarket (though I'd guess it's really very low in any case).
My recommendation for buying potatoes for growing is to go to a local farmers market and pick a variety from there.  You are likely to find potatoes that are already grown in your region, and you might be able to directly ask the farmer about disease for that variety, and whether or not it was grown organically.

974,"My neighbor must be advising her home painters to dump their leftover paint, for several days now, on a tree stump that she just last week said might need a pick axe to remove.  This stump is along our property line, 3 feet from my newly planted arborvitae, and 5 feet from the raspberry patch my granddaughter likes to help herself to.  I don't know what kind of paint this neighbor is using for the outside of her home, but, first day I noticed the paint, it was covering the stump that had a hole dug around it about 2' x 2' -- at that point I didn't know what this green goo was, but yesterday I actually saw the painter dumping in the hole! Will this kill my arborvitae, or the raspberry patch 5 feet away?  Will it be safe to eat these raspberries? 


A tree has roots that may be going 20 or 30 feet or more under the ground. If the paint is enough to kill the tree then it's probably enough to affect everything in that 20 foot radius. If not then the paint probably will not kill the tree.
In addition the paint will pollute the ground water and kill all the insects, worms and other things that your garden needs to grow. Clearly your neighbour is an unpleasant, inconsiderate person. Report him to the local council's environmental department and most house to somewhere with more amenable neighbours.
Digging out the tree root may require more than just a pick axe. Depending on the type of tree and size, you may need a small JCB to remove the root stump.

Not necessarily quick, but a cheap alternative would be to get a small punch and a stencil. Write the words onto the metal using the stencil and a (temporary) magic marker. Punch the words into the metal with the punch and a hammer using the marker as a guide.

Although myself, I buy seed potatoes from a garden centre, I know a lot of seasoned gardeners who buy them from the local food store and, after chitting them, if they are larger than a hen's egg, cut them in half. I would think that the chances of their being diseased or of rotting are minimal.
If you want to play it safe, you could let the cut ends dry for a day or two, and then dust them lightly with flowers of sulphur (a fungicide), before planting. I know quite a few old-school gardeners who swear by this method and have excellent crops.

I had an entire potato crop get hit by late blight (which didn't come in via the seed potatoes) a couple of years ago. Fortunately I was able to dig the potatoes and dispose of the plants before the tubers were affected -- they were fine to eat -- but I certainly didn't save any of those for planting the following year since they would be blight hosts.
How will you know if the ones you're buying aren't hosts?
The supermarket has no idea -- nor would they care -- whether the potatoes are carrying blight. As long as the tubers themselves aren't rotten, the market will carry them on the shelves. As a consumer you have no way of knowing if the potatoes were harvested early from a field showing signs of blight.
If you're just gardening for fun and a little fresh food, the risk of losing the whole crop is minimal.
If you're dependent on harvesting potatoes for food or income, you should seriously consider getting certified disease-free seed potatoes.

Covering seeds with a thin layer of compost or peat moss helps create a moist layer to prevent the seeds from drying out. Also will hopefully keep birds from eating the seeds. And of course, you must keep it damp (water twice a day during warm weather) for proper germination.

985,"I have a path with flagstone, with the gap between the stones being around an inch or so.  I've had creeping thyme growing between the stones, but it's been a huge battle keeping other plants, specifically clover (which I think may have already been living in the thyme plants when I brought them home from the nursery).  I've spent quite a bit of time pulling up the invaders and as much of their roots as possible, but it's been a very time-consuming process.  I'm worried that the clover might crowd out the thyme, which hasn't always been as hardy as I'd like.
Anyone have any pointers on maintaining healthy, mostly weed free ground covers, especially gap-filling plants?  Any hints on blocking or retarding the growth of invaders?  Or should I give up on this plant and try to find something that's going to grow more aggressively in this space (clover seems to like this location)?
Also, I'd prefer to stick to an organic solution and not use any harsh chemicals.


If you're aiming for uniformity, and you don't mind the look of the clover, I'd say just let the clover take over. My experiences with white clover are that it is capable of choking out pretty much everything else. It would provide a nice, low, green appearance to your path.

The tops of those plants look really healthy. You should be mounding up the soil around them as they grow -- these are taller than I've ever seen, so I have no idea what leaves should look like that low on the plant. By mounding up the soil you encourage the plant to grow more tubers higher up. Every 6-8"" of growth, mound up the soil around them.

988,"I planted strawberries a couple of years ago in a small patch of my back yard (in Sacramento, CA) and this year they are finally producing lots of strawberries. However, something is eating ""divots"" into them, as if something scooped out maybe a quarter to a third of the strawberry. 
I have netting to keep out squirrels and other larger critters. However, many of the strawberries have divots eaten into them and I found one or two of these with what looked like a small black worm in them. The worm was maybe 3/8"" long and less than 1/16"" wide and its body looked smooth and featureless to my unaided eye. 
Does anyone have an idea of whether these are the creatures that are eating my strawberries? If they are, what can I do to stop them? If something else is eating them, what could it be and what can I do about it? 
Thanks for your help.


My strawberries were damaged in the same way as yours, last year. The culprits proved to be Strawberry Seed Beetles (black, about 1cm long), which were living among some weeds nearby. They remove seeds from the outside of the fruit and also eat into it. I had netted the bed to protect it from birds, but had failed to weed around it - and these beetles are also attracted to weed seeds!
A slug killer would see them off, but it is not advisable to use chemicals near harvest time (and perhaps, like me, you are an organic gardener). I suggest you (1) make sure that nearby weeds are kept down,(2) clear away any dead leaves and garden rubbish,and (3) sink some jam jars into the soil around the bed - a lot of the beetles will fall into them, which will reduce their numbers. It may also be worth finding out if there is an organic slug repellent that would be effective against them, which I intend to do myself.

This site describes (with copious pictures) the problem you are having.
A possible solution from the site:

Andrea from LifestyleBlock suggested I try using a solution of apple cider vinegar and spray the strawberries several times a day. Since I only had white vinegar I used that instead. The mix I did was 1 tablespoon vinegar to a litre of water. For 5 days now I have been diligently spraying the partially ripe strawberries and it seems to be working.

992,"I've been using ""Tomato Maker"" (4-2-6) fertilizer, which supposedly has enough calcium to prevent blossom end rot, but I'm still getting blossom end rot on my super marzano tomatoes (no BER problems on any other varieties I'm growing this year). 
Are there other things that can cause blossom end rot besides calcium deficiency? Is the super marzano variety (or plum tomatoes in general) particularly susceptible? Could my plants still be suffering from calcium deficiency even with the Tomato Maker fertilizer?
In case it would be helpful to know, I live in the California Central Valley, which has hot, dry summers, but spring this year was unusually cool and rainy. 
I'd be interested in any advice on what, if anything, I can do now to reduce blossom end rot on this year's crop and also what I can do in the future to prevent BER from turning up at all.


According to notes by the Alabama  A&M and Auburn Universities:

BER is caused by calcium deficiency, usually induced by fluctuations in the plant's water supply. Because calcium is not a highly mobile element in the plant, even brief fluctuations in the water supply can cause BER. Also, if plants are growing in highly acidic soil or are getting too much water from either heavy rain, over-irrigation or high relative humidity, they can develop calcium deficiency and BER.
This is a very full paper, which goes on to suggest steps that can be taken to control BER, and points out that some varieties tend to be more susceptible to the conditions that cause BER.

995,"I have this recipe that I found from my Granddad's place for making potting soil, for which I need 120 gallons (or for a 16 cubic foot raised box). The recipe calls for the following ingredients:

5 parts compost
4 parts lava sand
3 parts peat moss
2 parts cedar flakes
1 part soft rock phosphate
1/2 part something
1/4 part something 2 

Could someone please help me with how much each of these ingredients are to make 120 gallons or 16 ft cubed? Thanks.


It's just a set of proportions. If you take any measure, say a scoop, then the recipe says to use 5 scoops of compost, 4 scoops of lava sand etc.
In your case to make just over 120 gallons use 1 part = 8 gallons, resulting in:

40 gallons compost 
32 gallons lava sand
etc ...
2 gallons something 2

996,"I realise I've put runner beans close to an overhanging damson tree. 
The beans closest to the damson have scaled my supports and have bridged the gap between support and tree and started to climb on into the branches of the damson.
Leaving aside unsuitability of growing vegetables close to trees (loss of light and nutrients), is there a problem with the beans climbing on and on into the tree? (apart from the obvious one of it being hard to harvest the crop of course).
What I mean is, will the plants put excessive effort into climbing and set fewer flowers/beans?
If so, should I just pinch out the tops?


Every time my runner beans grow beyond or above where I want them to I pinch them off and they seem to cope just fine, they don't seem to suffer any adverse effects and flower as you would expect.
Admittedly, I restrict their height on purely cosmetic grounds, so I haven't seen how they perform if left to overgrow branches above them.

1003,"I am growing some lemongrass (in a pot) and it's doing very well so far: over the past month, it went from a stump, to about 20-30cm high, with long thin leaves.
My question is: what the best way to encourage its growth in such a way that it produces the strong stalks that are typically used in cooking (afaik, the soft part of the leaves aren't good for that use). And how/when should I go at pruning/harvesting them without stunting further growth?
PS: probably not relevant but just in case: my local weather is about sub-tropical levels of hot and humid (Japanese Summer).


As per winwaed said, you got a pretty good climate for them.
Lemongrass love sun, love water.
Give them sun. Give them plenty of water.
They would like a sandy soil which have good drainage and yet good ability to retain water. If you soil retain water pretty good, then you can add some sand in it for better drainage.
Use a BIG pot which is wider than 1 feet. My recommendation is 1.5-2 feet wide pot.
Cut their leave once a month or longer to encourage growth. If you don't cut, it would be weak. Cut the whole leave, don't cut in a halfway.

Cherry trees grow with a single upward leader, all other branches come out sideways from this. When the tree gets to the desired height, simply prune off the growing tip of the central leader. The tree with no longer gain height but will instead put its efforts into sideways branching, flowers and fruit.
Cherry trees are susceptible to diseases if pruned too early in the year. Leave the tree until winter before pruning.

Say I've done this again: 

I go out and I plant two rows of beets, two rows of turnips, two rows of radishes and two rows of carrots. 

Given beets, carrots and radishes like 18 inches between rows and turnips like 24 inches between rows. How close do I plant the first row of turnips to the last row of beets and how close do I plant the last row of turnips to the first row of radishes? 


""How to Grow More Vegetables"" by John Jeavons, deals with exactly this question. Page 160, ""Companion Planting; In Space"" -- he's talking about companion planting corn and beets intermingled in a bed, but the same logic applies to your question:

... One way to determine the spacing for different plants grown together is to add their spacing together and divide by 2. If you grow corn and beets together, add 15 inches and 4 inches for a total of 9 inches. Divide by 2 and you get a per-plant spacing of 9 1/2 inches. The beets, then, would be 9 1/2 inches from each corn plant and vice versa.

This is followed by a diagram showing how each corn plant gets the necessary 15"" diameter growing space, and each beet gets its necessary 4"" diameter space.

Backyard orchard culture has some thoughts on keeping fruit trees at a desirable height (the height of the grower).  Essentially you make a cherry ""bush"" more than a tree through:

Pruning the tree for low initial
branching (started by topping the
tree at 2ft or less). 
Pruning during
the growing season in addition to
the normal dormant pruning to keep
the tree at the desired level

I've watched a good video that discusses this method, though I haven't tried it myself.

I'd recommend something like a puncture resistent glove that's much stronger than leather (the page says 4 times). This is also ergonomically designed, so you won't have much discomfort.
These are most often bought by people who cut their fingers on the kitchen slicers. So while it's not really a ""gardening glove"", I see no reason to not use it as one. Also, it's pretty inexpensive at $14.

In my experience its best to just let the bean climb. As far as I know, the larger the plant gets, the more beans you'll get, since the plant has a bigger platform and more nodes to produce bean pods. Might be a different story depending on the variety of bean though.

I don't know what kind of paint this neighbor is using for the outside of her home, but, first day I noticed the paint, it was covering the stump that had a hole dug around it about 2' x 2' -- at that point I didn't know what this green goo was, but yesterday I actually saw the painter dumping in the hole! Will this kill my arborvitae, or the raspberry patch 5 feet away?  Will it be safe to eat these raspberries? 


generally, fruit is the safest part of a plant to eat when considering bio-accumulation of toxins present in soil. This is because it is the last and furthest destination for toxins. The roots tend to be most toxic, then stems, then leaves, then fruit.
Is it safe enough? I would eat the berries but its a judgement call. I'd rather eat those than pesticide laced berries from the grocery store.
If your berry patch is significantly upslope from the paint area, its roots may not even come into contact with the paint

JSBangs is right on about not over-cutting.  Some other important considerations are

Keep your blades sharp to prevent any tearing whatsoever. Put away the string trimmer when your lawn is having problems.
Get a testing kit to check the fertility and pH of your lawn area and correct if needed.
Keep the grass long enough to shade the roots in hot months.
Encourage deep roots by watering deep and less often if you do need to irrigate.
Prevent stressors such as weed competition and grubs.

1038,"I understand that it's important to water sufficiently and not just dampen the surface.
But does it actually do damage to water very briefly, or is it better than nothing? I'm thinking about a situation where you might be rushing to work in the morning and your time is very limited.


This would probably depend on the nature of your soil, the type of plants involved, the stage in their development, their drought tolerance and whether it is long- or short-term watering.
In the case of seedlings, for instance, in very warm weather, short-term superficial watering cannot do any damage by causing surface rooting, since their roots haven't yet grown down very far, so a brief watering must be far better than none which would compromise their survival.
On the other hand, if, for example, we take a reasonably drought-resistant and well-established variety of sweet corn, growing in a humus-rich, water-retentive soil before 'cobbing', it might be better to withhold water for a few days, until you can water it thoroughly - unless, of course, we're talking about a 'one-off' or short-term watering. In fact, withholding water for a short time might even encourage the plants to root more deeply and extensively in search of it.

It is hard for my local area to acquire jalapeno seeds, so I am wondering if it is possible to grow jalapenos from these seeds in the pickled jalapenos.
The juice is made with water, salt and acidity regulator.


Most likely no.
The pickling process typically boils the bottles to a point that kills any organisms in order to prevent spoilage -- this includes the seeds.
(I say ""most likely"" because some pickling processes are done cold and use a more natural sort of fermentation. But unless you got your pickled peppers at a very traditional sort of shop or from an old-school farmer at a farmers' market, they've been boiled and the seeds will not grow.)
Beyond the processing issue, even if the seeds were viable, if your peppers happen to be a hybrid variety, you won't get plants that produce the same fruit.
Considering that you can get 100 viable jalapeno seeds for under US$2, it's really not worth bothering trying to salvage the debris off the bottom of the pickle jar...

Cereal boxes have been in the news recently, in Europe. According to the latest research, they may leak harmful mineral oils into the foods they contain - oils which originate mainly from the ink in the recycled newspapers that are used to make them and, to a lesser extent, from the printing ink on the box, and may be carcinogenic.
As yet, there is no hard evidence that these mineral oil hydrocarbons that migrate into our foodstuffs are a health hazard ; and even if they are, those that are present in the cardboard might well be converted into harmless substances on contact with the soil, over time. However, given the potential risk, I would definitely avoid introducing them into the food chain by using cereal boxes either as a mulch or a composting material.

This is almost certainly Powdery Mildew (see photo), a fungal disease that prefers high  humidity and occurs most often during a spell of cool days and humid nights. A severe attack will destroy plants' leaves and reduce their yield. You can control it chemically with a copper or sulfur-based fungicide, or organically, using the following recipe, which I haven't tried myself but I gather is very effective.

Am I better off severing the outside roots, thus keeping only the main root system in the black box?
Should I attempt to take each root-bunch to the destination? (May not be possible without damaging the vine in transit -- several heavy soil-heavy clumps)
Other ideas?



This is just a suggestion - but time, I believe is of the essence.
I think you may have a problem with soil compaction around the place where those vines are taking root so I'm not sure how you're going to get it out of there.  What you could do is cover the vine with soil where the topsoil where it is taking root.  Wait a week so while keeping the soil pretty moist (dig a little trench around the secondary root).  Then when you feel that the baby is ready to have it's umbilical cord snipped, do it.  Dig deep and plop it in an empty pot for transporting to your garden.
Again, this is just a suggestion. But, I really doubt that the secondary root will survive being cut as is.

1077,"I've been trying to find out about feeding my peppers plants. So far the information I've found is very inconsistent, so I'd like something as definitive as possible.
When should I start feeding my pepper plants?
And from then, how frequently should I feed them?


Technically you only need to feed them when the soil is deficient of one or more nutrients. This is probably why you see such a range of advice - people grow them in a range of conditions, composts, etc. For example a pot or re-used compost is more likely to become deficient of nutrients.
Personally I usually only feed them once - usually a few weeks after the seedlings (or store bought plants) have been potted on to their final location. This gives them time to get established. I use a general purpose liquid fertilizer feed. My conditions are: raised beds built up with soil and compost (and annually fortified with new compost),  plus pots with mixed store-bought compost.
The only other time I've used a feed was a few years ago when I had some trouble with seedlings getting started. Thinking it was an extreme nutrient deficiency essential at germination, I used the feed as soon as the seedlings appeared. With hindsight I suspect I was seeing damping-off.

In this related question, I answered:

A handful of compost should be about the consistency of a damp sponge. What I do is add water when I turn the pile: I turn the hose on a little bit, set it in the spot where the pile is going to be, and start shoveling material onto it. After a couple of inches of depth, I raise the hose, so the water trickles into the center of the pile. Then shovel some more, repeatedly lifting the hose every couple inches of depth. This way, the whole height of the pile gets some moisture.
If it has been hot, and we haven't had any rain, I'll also dump waste water onto the pile. (E.g. soiled water from animal buckets.)

When purchased from the shop, it looks exactly as shown below.



Although I have no experience of this particular variety,  I suspect that the main reason why its leaves are yellowing is that it is receiving too much direct light. These plants prefer indirect light. They are fairly tolerant of low-light conditions and the room in which it lives looks light enough for its needs; the light tube is probably doing more harm than good. I would:

switch off the light and move the plant nearer to the window. 
change the water less frequently, retaining some of the existing water, as already suggested, but using only bottled water.
feed it every month or so.
try growing it in a suitable potting compost (kept moist, but not wet), if, after allowing time for fresh, healthy foliage to grow, there is no improvement.

1107,"I inherited an established garden in which a very sad-looking peony was struggling to grow right next to (practically from under) a rose.  In the two growing seasons I've been at this house, the peony's few leaves were a yellow-green and it never sent up a flowering shoot.  In May this year I moved the rose that was next to it (due to a color scheme I didn't agree with), and at the same time, I removed the peony. It looks as if the peony managed to grow from a bit of root was left after the previous owner tried to remove it and replace it with some roses, but perhaps it was too deep in the soil, or constantly cut back, or too malnourished to grow successfully. I potted up the bits of root, some with leaf still attached, hoping that I could get at least one plant. I've been keeping the potting compost moist but not water-logged and keeping the pots out of direct sunlight.  Is this the right thing to do to save the peony, or is there a better method? 


In the fall dig the peony and the rose out.  Amend the soil and replant them at a reasonable distance.   You can prune the rose back at that time.  They will recover over the winter and re-establish. Bear in mind that peonies love to be fed.  Don't skimp on that.

Compost sounds like the main thing you want. This will primarily add nutritional value to the soil (to be fair clay minerals can hold all sorts of mineral ions - but no humus or water holding ability) but also improve drainage, digging, and it will be easier for roots to penetrate.
Over time the compost will break down so you will probably always adding it, just at a much lower rate in future years. 
I would also add some sandy soil for the first few years - this will do a good job of improving the drainage.

It does an excellent job of breaking the clay here and things now grow like mad in it.  I also spread compost and dig it in as well.  
What other things are people doing to make heavy clay soils productive?


Just to round off the sterling advice already given: if it is available, I would definitely add plenty of well-rotted horse manure (not farmyard or cattle manure, which is more suitable for amending light soils). Over time, horse or stable manure - preferably one that contains plenty of straw, rather than wood shavings - will open up the soil structure, and improve aeration and drainage

1114,"I have a couple of grapevines that were planted 3 years ago.
The first year, they didn't do much.
The second year, there was lots of growth, but only a couple of grapes.
This year, I pruned it back quite a bit (I have 3 vines in an 8' garden) but each of the vines has 3-6 shoots coming right out of the ground.  Should I trim these off now, or wait until fall?


My father-in-law (who has been growing grapes for decades) came over on the weekend and cut off all the shoots.  When I asked him about it, he said that none of them would produce any grapes this year, and they'd end up getting pruned next spring, so there was no harm in pulling them off now.

It's a good idea to prune them now before the normal pruning time. They are not going to be useful for the future of the vine or fruit in the short term so they are a waste of energy that would go to other parts of the vine.
"
1122,"I started my garden this year with 8 tomato plants. Between disease, over watering and a misadventure with a plastic softball I have lost about half of them. My wife wants enough tomatoes to can some salsa and probably some spaghetti sauce and I don't want to disappoint her. 
Is it too late to grab some more tomato seedlings and try to add some more? Is there a late summer/fall variety I should look for that will produce a good number of yummy tomatoes? Our falls are fairly warm and we don't get much frost until October or sometimes even November. 


If you can find some seedlings, you should still be able to get some fruit. Sounds like you've got about 90 days until frost, which is enough time for tomatoes to ripen -- at least according to the seed packets I've got handy. Just check the time to maturity on the plants you buy.
"
1123,"I understand that it's important to water sufficiently and not just dampen the surface.
But does it actually do damage to water very briefly, or is it better than nothing? I'm thinking about a situation where you might be rushing to work in the morning and your time is very limited.


Mancuniensis' gave a good answer.
I'd add that you won't do any harm if it's right before harvest -- especially if you know the plants really need the water. (E.g. lettuce you're going to pick soon that needs a little watering.)
Also watch out for plants that are sensitive to changes in watering: tomatoes during fruiting (blossom end rot and/or cracking), cabbages with mature heads (splitting), etc. If you do a ""little"" watering on a regular basis (weekdays before you head to work), then flood them with water (a weekend soaking) you may injure the crop.
I invested in a hose timer and some soaker hoses so I can (a) give a good soaking and (b) provide a consistent amount of water to plants that are sensitive to regular water levels. (Tomato, cabbage, celery.)
"
1127,"I purchased a home in Utah with an existing Xeriscaped landscaping area, and discovered later that some of the ""native"" plants were, in fact, Myrtle Spurge, a ground cover that's considered a noxious weed in at least Colorado and Oregon, but other states are quickly becoming wary of the plant.
It tends to grow quickly and spread, and I find that I am removing the new plants each year.
I'm thinking of eradicating all of it, but it does have some aesthetic qualities. I don't mind replacing it with another succulent plant, but I wonder if the noxious weed status is fully warranted?
Should I remove all trace of this plant from my xeriscape?


Looks pleasant enough,  But I see you are in Utah - so if OR and CO have such a take-no-prisoners attitude to it, I think eradication is probably the only option.
The link you posted even said that cultivation is banned in CO - an unusual status even for an invasive plant.
On the other hand, the OR list (linked from the Wikipedia article) lists Mesquite on the OR noxious/invasive list. Here in Texas there's definitely a love/hate relationship with Mesquite but I wouldn't call it noxious and definitely not invasive. So what I'm trying to say is that climate matters. Does your climate resemble the Colorado and Oregon areas that have a problem with this weed? If so, eradicate with extreme prejudice!

I would say do it now. Get some seedlings and get them started and you should get a good crop in 90 days. I live in Florida and last year I started tomatoes in November and got a huge crop in the winter. What I did was anytime that the weather got below 40 degrees I covered the tomatoes and they made it through any cold weather just fine. We had many days last December where there was frost and temps in the low thirties and suffered no damage. We harvested steadily for over a month starting in early February. 

"
1140,"Does anyone have any plant recommendations that could deter mosquitoes? The location is North Texas, and I am looking for something that could be used on or around the deck. This might make the deck more comfortable in summer, but it may also deter them coming in the back door when it is open for the dog (we don't have a dog flap and it is a glass door).
So pots might be the most convenient, but there's a bed below the longest length of the deck, and there's additional space for new (small) beds if need be. It should not smell bad to humans, and ideally be decorative (edible works too!).
None of the botanical solutions seem to work. Citronella never seems to work, and those candles have a low melting point - ie. They can get messy if left out in the Texas summer heat. I've heard of aromatic wood chips being used, but it seems we'd need a lot and they'd require regular replenishment - ie. expensive over the long term. 


Mosquito shoo geraniums were biogenetically engineered with pockets of citronella that rupture and let out the citronella into the air which irritates the mosquitoes feet as the plant grows. They are winter hardy only in tropical regions so they are normally used as potted houseplants. 
"
1141,"Last year I used row covers on PVC frames to effectively keep cabbage worms off my broccoli and cabbage. I put the covers on in spring as soon as I put the seedlings in the ground, and then took them off when the plants were larger. There were some worms in the broccoli when I harvested, but they don't do much damage and come out of the heads with a good soaking when brought inside.
This year I didn't put the covers on early like I should have, and I'm wondering: is worth my time to put covers over more mature plants that already have cabbage worms? Will I just be ""locking the bad bugs in""? What if I first spray with Bt, which seems to have been effective at controlling them so far, and then cover?


Wood ashes sprinkled over the plants causes present worms to shrivel and die and prevents future worms. It also is high in phosphorous and can be used in place of lime.

1146,"My apricot tree is infested with black and white beetles on the branches. They are 2-3 cm / 1 inch long. I can't find an identification on the web. There is no visible damage to the tree. Is this beetle a pest? Should I be removing them?
My location is the Mediterranean / Middle East.




That is a Capnodis tenebrionis (L.). - Peach Flatheaded Rootborer.
They seem to be fairly problematic, and HIGHLY UNWANTED.  They are very destructive to the plant.

Larvae and adults damage saplings and young stone-fruit cultures. Adults devour cortex, leafstalks, and fruit buds. Orchard bushes lose their leaves after C. tenebrionis mass abundance. Economic significance is greater in southern arid regions, especially in Eastern Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Irrigation of orchards during oviposition period is one of the pest control measures because it destroys most eggs.

It must be the tool I use the most - whether it is for planting small/medium plants out; filling plant pots with compost; or even re-arranging the gravel ground cover on a 'desert' pot or the xeriscape bed.
Don't buy one that is going to break in half - but don't dig in soil with a trowel that is likely to break your trowel.

A shovel, if your garden is small.
A transplanter, although it is more cumbersome
A weeder (for getting rid of dandelions)

Valuable to help cut through weeds and move / cultivate soil.  Comes in many types (ex. hula hoe, stirrup, flat, etc.) and most all work well to help cut weeds just under the surface easier.  Used any time you need to chop, push, or pull amounts of soil or crop.

A hoe is a must have for a new gardener, it can make up for the absence of the following tools:

Tamper
Row maker (these are usually makeshift anyway)

1152,"Delighted to observe that the rat poison we put down was disappearing. 
Less delighted to find some weeks later that they had moved it all to a larder in the compost. The poison is Slaymore (as far as I understand it is a standard household rat poison). It comes in the form of blue pellets.
Does this render the compost dangerous to use on a kitchen garden (ie. with all kinds of vegetables)?


Slaymore contains bromadiolone, an anticoagulant that is toxic to rodents and other mammals, as well as poultry and fish.
A data sheet on bromadiolone claims that it will not be taken up by plants in case of spillage. It also talks briefly about cleaning up spills.
Even with this information, I'd be hesitant to apply that compost to anything I'm going to feed my family.
For future use, you may want to investigate bait stations that prevent the rat from removing the bait.

Rake

Useful to lightly till/loosen soil, remove weeds that aren't too stubborn, level the soil and collect fallen leaves and cut grass. Rakes come in two basic shapes:

The sturdily built soil rake and
A more flexible and fanned out grass rake

If you can afford only one rake, get the soil rake as you can use it to collect leaves (maybe not grass all that well), but you certainly can't use the grass rake to work on soil. Images below from wikimedia commons.

1156,"If I spray some grass with a poison like Round-up or Kills All, how long before that spray is not dangerous to plants?
So for example, if after spraying, I walk through the sprayed area and then onto my lawn, how long until I am not going to be leaving ""foot prints of death""?


Although the label might say it's ok to plant again after 2-3 days, do note that different products have different time frames and you should read the label for your product carefully.  
Even then, you shouldn't trust manufacturer's claims. This article cites a 1993 EPA study showing that glyphosate (Roundup) half-life can persist in agricultural soil for over four months. (Scroll down to figure 6 and the section titled ""Persistence and Movement in Soil"".) And that's just the half-life! Glyphosate does not break down quickly.
Note that Monsanto has been in trouble in both New York and France for false advertising regarding Roundup biodegrading in soil and exaggerated safety claims.

I use a D-Handled Spade. I worked as a professional gardener for more than a decade, and while I first went with a long straight-handled spade, I changed over to the short and perfected my digging technique after a few years. I think it saved my back, and I know nothing else does the deed as well if you're double digging. Also you should sharpen the bottom edge with a file for best performance.

1164,"I've been growing my tomatoes up a 6ft trellis of nylon netting for the last couple of years, with good results.  But they tend to grow out of control, eventually toppling over the trellis and breaking their branches, and parts of the branches will die out.  I've never really bothered with pruning them unless a vine looks diseased or like it's dying.
I've read that I really ought to be pruning the tomatoes to the ""main vine"", which will result in higher fruit yields.  But I'm not sure how to tell which vine is the ""main"" vine (or if it really matters), and which vines are just branches.  After a week, both vines look rather strong.  And when both vines have flowers, I'm anxious about cutting away potential produce!  Will pruning it really result in higher yields?
What rules of thumb do you use for pruning your trellised tomato vines?


Pinch for sure. Another trick is to let the plants grow in pots and when you transplant, bury them four inches deeper. This promotes more root growth. Stay on it. Pinch frequently until they are producing.

1165,"I've just potted a frangipani (plumeria) cutting given to me by a friend and since it's not in its natural climate, I'm wondering what conditions it will thrive in?  If it matters, I live in a temperate zone.
How should I water it?  How much sun does it need?  Fertiliser?  Does it need to be changed with the seasons?


They are succulent, and I've seen them thrive in very hot, dry weather (Kona, Hawai`i). If they don't get enough sun or if they get too much water, the plant will be lanky. Use lots of nitrogen rich fertilizer to get them to produce plentiful blooms.

1166,"I bought these basil plants from the store. They looked a little droopy and wilting. They came with several bunches and they were half off and discounted because they've been there in the store so long.
The instructions on the bag indicated to put in a cup of water a little past the root. We did that and they seemed near their death after doing so. Are there any remedies to revive them? 
The plant currently sits indoors in one of my very large beer mug. By my kitchen sink away from the cat. 


It may be past the possibility of resuscitation, but I would recommend sunlight. Assuming you're in Texas perhaps not direct sun right now, but more than it would be getting inside.
You also could try pulling off leaves which are already so wilted they're not going to stay or little ones that don't have a large enough surface area to catch much light. This means you're maximising the energy from sunlight that's going to the remainder of the plant, and not letting any go to waste on the lost-cause leaves.
"
1168,"I have a few ferns with long pointed leaves, and their tips have turned brown. The plant is otherwise healthy, and is actively growing. 
What is causing that? Should I worry about it?


In addition to those already given (insufficient humidity and very high ambient temperature), one of the most common causes of leaf-tip/ edge browning is an over-dry compost, resulting from:

insufficient watering;
ineffective watering*

*Where a peat-based potting compost has dried out completely, and has very often shrunk away from the sides of the pot; the water just runs through the gap and exits the pot without really wetting the compost. Many potting composts - particularly peat-based ones - are very difficult to wet, if they are allowed to dry out; surface watering is ineffective, and the best way to ensure that the compost is thoroughly wet, is to stand the pot in a bucket of water (to just below the rim) for an hour or so, and then drain it for a time to ensure that the plant is not sitting in water afterwards.

1169,"I know that Oleander ( Nerium oleander ) is poisonous. Almost every book and webpage about this plant warns the readers. But how poisonous is this plant?

Wiki describes it as 'one of the most poisonous plants in the world', here, and children are known to have died from chewing its leaves, here. Although it only seems to be dangerous if ingested, I would give it a wide berth, particularly if there are children or pets around.

5 Tined Garden Cultivator
I've never figured out how to use one of those twirly cultivators without getting it all gummed up.  Fortunately a co-worker was getting rid of all his inherited gardening tools and I got one of these.  It beats a hoe for getting rid of annoying weeds.   But it is pretty much useless against grass. 
If you want to cultivate your garden deeply for a rotating crop without using a gas powered mantis tiller, I'd find one of these puppies.

1173,"Will cauliflower do anything after you pick the main flower like broccoli or should I just pull the whole plant out when I'm harvesting?


Cauliflower does not usually develop side shoots, therefore most people will dig up the whole plant after harvesting the heads.

1174,"I have a section of my lawn which seems prone to standing water, grass that doesn't grow very quickly, and seems very hard-packed. I think it's probably in desperate need of aeration.
What is the proper way to know when and how much to aerate? Also, since I have a small lawn, is there such a thing as a small lawn aerator and will it get the job done?
Edit:
As it turns out, there is a small aerator, like this one:

I purchased one recently and it works rather well. Obviously not a good choice for a sizable lawn, but for my small lawn this worked extremely well. I'm seeing some improvement already in the grass gradually becoming more green.


How to aerate is covered by the other answers, but as for how to know if you need areation:
If you can easily sink a spade into your soil down to the handle, it doesn't need to be aerated.  If you have to force the spade into the ground and/or pound it with a hammer, your soil needs to be aerated.
The other sign that aeration is needed is if water isn't draining into the soil properly (which it sounds like you have).  If you have lots of puddles after a rainstorm, you probably need the soil aerated.

1185,"I have a large (70L?) moulded plastic pot which is filled with topsoil, and has a freshly planted lilac bush in it. I had noticed this pot did not have drainage holes at the bottom, but had thought that the large volume would allow for a fair amount of water to be locked away in the soil.
I've quickly noticed that I am getting a fair amount of standing water on top of the soil, even after fairly modest watering.
Should I drill drainage holes in the bottom of this pot, or is there another suggestion on how to deal with this situation?


If it was me, I would most definitely drill some drainage holes in the bottom of that pot.
Standing water will greatly increase the chance of disease developing within the soil...
Standing water also greatly increases the possibility of plant root rot.
I'm sure there is the odd occasion where one might not need drainage holes in a pot, but I have personally never encountered such a circumstance.

1188,"Something has been eating my tomatoes just as they begin to ripen. Each day I've been finding one or more tomatoes half-eaten but still attached to the vine. On a couple of days I've also found bits of tomato skin scattered around a wooden chair a few feet away from the tomato plants.  
I haven't seen the critter(s) in the act. I'm guessing it's a squirrel, as we have lots of them in the neighborhood, but it could be some other small mammal.
I've grown tomatoes in the Sacramento region for years and this is the first time I've had this problem. Does anyone have any ideas on whether it's likely to be a squirrel or some other animal? More importantly, is there anything I can do to keep the critters away?
Update: I've selected a ""best"" answer, but please feel free to add your suggestions if you have a better idea. I'd love to find a way to deter the tomato-eating critters without going to the trouble of enclosing my tomato garden in a net.


This is a situation where a net might be the best option. Put it on stakes to hold it over the plants, and arrange it so it can be easily lifted or pulled aside for harvesting. make sure the net touches the ground so squirrels can't get underneath.
This spring I made little teepees of chicken wire to keep them off my yucca seedlings. You will want something lighter (and in larger sheets). For squirrels the netting has to go over the plants, they'll easily climb over or jump into a fenced off area.

Update: I've selected a ""best"" answer, but please feel free to add your suggestions if you have a better idea. I'd love to find a way to deter the tomato-eating critters without going to the trouble of enclosing my tomato garden in a net.


I think I would go with winwaed's answer, but if you find out the culprit is a slightly bigger creature, I might then be tempted to look into getting a ""Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler"" system (like this one) to humanely scare away the hungry creatures...

1190,"I know that Oleander ( Nerium oleander ) is poisonous. Almost every book and webpage about this plant warns the readers. But how poisonous is this plant? I can touch the leaves without any skin irritation. I can prune it without using gloves. What happens if somebody ( a small child, a dog ) starts chewing a leaf?


According to INCHEM:

A single leaf may be lethal to a child (Shaw & Pearn, 1979).

Just below that:

One leaf of N. oleander may be sufficient to kill a sheep (Shaw & Pearn, 1979).  The lethal dose of N. oleander leaves reported for several animal species is about 0.5 mg/kg.

1191,"I bought these basil plants from the store. They looked a little droopy and wilting. They came with several bunches and they were half off and discounted because they've been there in the store so long.
The instructions on the bag indicated to put in a cup of water a little past the root. We did that and they seemed near their death after doing so. Are there any remedies to revive them? 
The plant currently sits indoors in one of my very large beer mug. By my kitchen sink away from the cat. 


I'd try an organic supplement spray like Sea Magic.  I've had great success with vegetable, fruit, herb, and houseplants that start to look wilted to get them to perk up again.  It is used to help encourage stronger growth and more production and also helps prohibit leaf decay while stimulating foliage production too.  Sea Kelp or Fish Fertilizer would probably be an option worth trying to perhaps more readily available in garden centers.

1201,"I planted a batch of ""zesty blend"" lettuce seeds. They seem to be doing fine, but suddenly they started flowering:

Have they bolted? They look healthy otherwise. Still edible?


Yes, bolting means ""flowering and ready to set seed"". When it sends up that long flower stalk, it's all done.
As for ""is it edible"": it will probably be bitter enough that you won't want to eat it.
Lettuce in summer is tricky -- long days and heat makes it want to bolt. Now that you've seen it happen once, you know what it looks like and you can keep an eye on it next time around and harvest it once it starts to show signs. Giving it some shade can also help it last a little longer.
If you still have seed, I'd go ahead and start another batch -- starting a few new plants every couple of weeks will keep you in lettuce from now until the ground freezes solid.
"
1202,"I planted a batch of ""zesty blend"" lettuce seeds. They seem to be doing fine, but suddenly they started flowering:

Have they bolted? They look healthy otherwise. Still edible?


Simple answer is yes, flower shoots on lettuce is a sure sign of bolting.
Lettuce is a cool season crop, meaning it prefers to be grown in mid to late Spring and (early) Autumn (Fall).
If your lettuce was planted in full sun and temperatures have constantly been over 75°F (24°C) during the day time, that is the cause of the problem.
"
1203,"I planted a batch of ""zesty blend"" lettuce seeds. They seem to be doing fine, but suddenly they started flowering:

It appears as though it has likely started to bolt.  You can attempt to eat it but be warned as it may be slightly tougher and bitter than you are accustomed to.  The longer you wait the worse of it will potentially taste but it is still edible.  If it's not to your liking, simply pull it up and put it in your compost pile (if the seeds are not yet mature) and attempt to grow some more as the season allows you to.

1204,"I planted a batch of ""zesty blend"" lettuce seeds. They seem to be doing fine, but suddenly they started flowering:

Lettuce often runs to seed prematurely when it is stressed. Apart from the reasons already mentioned, drought and overcrowding can cause it to bolt. As pointed out, you can eat it after it has bolted, but it will have a bitter flavor.
Mine do better when under a thick-mesh netting grow tunnel (see photo) which provides them with some much-needed shade and also protects them against bird and slug damage.

1205,"This discussion of seed storage got me wondering if it is feasible to harvest seeds from vegetables (I'm partial to tomatoes) as I cut them up for consumption. 
Generally, I buy seeds each year. But if I have a steady supply, and it's not ill-advised, could I not save seeds for the next year? If so, what steps should I take? Is there a reason not to save vegetable seeds?


I consider seed collecting to be a part of the whole experience of gardening.  Experiment a bit.  If something works, keep collecting those seeds, if another one doesn't, go on and try harvesting from a different plant. I think it's just more rewarding when you get a plant from seeds you harvested and sowed yourself, the same way it's more rewarding to pick that first tomato plant from the vine rather than from the produce aisle.  Also, it give you something to do as your garden is winding down for the year.

1212,"I know that tomatoes should be transplanted deeper than they were in the previous pot.
When I'm potting up broccoli and cabbage, are they the same way? Can I bury part of the stem when I go from a 6-pack to a pot, or from a pot to the garden?
(I'm especially interested because my current batch of broccoli got a little leggy when I started them under the lights.)


When I pot on (transfer to a larger pot) brassica seedlings, I always bury part of the stem, so that their lowest leaves are just above the surface of the soil. This encourages more root formation and gives them greater stability, particularly if they are leggy. So far, this method of transplanting has worked well for me, although I don't use it for the cucurbits (courgettes/ zucchini, squash etc), as these are fairly prone to stem rot. Of course, it's important to avoid over-watering and ensure that the compost/ soil is free-draining.

1215,"(Asiatic Garden Beetles are a new pest in the mid-atlantic and northeast US.  They look like a smaller, cinnamon-colored European Chafer, the size and shape of a coffee bean.  The grubs do the usual grub thing.  The adults are nocturnal and feast on vegetable and flower foliage.)
We're in NH, and are going to lose our basil plants if I don't come up with a way to control these things (adults) within a few days - they are defoliating the plants.  I'm thinking to put row cover over the plants, but I want to be sure I'm going to be keeping the beetles out - not in!


Unfortunately, as I live in the UK, where this beetle isn't a problem, I can't offer you any advice based on personal experience.  However, I have just done a quick search and hope the following links help. Apparently, the adult beetles spend their days just below the surface of the soil - close to their favorite meal! - before emerging at night.

1224,"We transplanted an assortment of pretty flowers for our windowsill some weeks ago (albeit rather crudely) and they were growing bright and healthy. Over the last week, however they've been plagued! I live in Scotland and suspect the pest is the midge.
The predominant flower is Phlox drummondii and this is the flower that is preferentially being eaten by the larvae, starting at the root and lower stem, reducing them to withered hairs (circled); then when the plant collapses the buggers eat the leaves!
I've tried bug spray but this has had little or no effect in trammelling their advance. Many have now become adults. Any advice appreciated!



Given the time of year, the insect's appearance in the close-up and the fact that you live in Scotland, the damage is almost certainly being caused by the infamous Scottish midge - which has spoiled so many of my holidays in the Highlands!

1228,"I have a cherry tree that is about 2 years old. Strangely, the width of its trunk above the grafting joint is much thicker than that of the rootstock (mazzard) below and I have not seen such a variation in any of my other young trees. Should I be concerned that this might be a weak spot as the tree grows bigger? Will this even out eventually or is there something I can do to ""correct"" it?



I'm not an expert, but this suggests to me that the twig/ bud that was used for the graft (the scion) was taken from a far more vigorous variety than the rootstock, and therefore their growth rates are incompatible or, perhaps, that the graft was not well done (see photo).
I doubt that you can do anything to ""correct"" it. If the tree crops heavily, it would be advisable to give it some support, to compensate for the increased strain on the union which is almost certainly weak.

1230,"I bought some gooseberries and planted them in some self-watering containers. They did well for a few weeks but now one has lost all of its leaves and the other is losing some leaves, while other leaves are turning yellow and brown. In short, they are not thriving.
I've moved the containers a few times to adjust the levels of sunlight -- one thing I tried was to put them next to currants, which are doing well -- but this hasn't helped. More recently, I added some additional compost, heavy on eggshells, with the idea that this would provide missing nutrients. Still no dice. Any ideas? If it is relevant, I live in Massachusetts, near Boston.


There is no doubt that gooseberries, while preferring the open ground, can be grown successfully in containers, provided that:

you plant no more than one per container;
the container is large enough - ideally, at least 2 feet deep by 2 feet wide;
the compost is free-draining;
they are watered and fertilized regularly;
they are not over-watered (the soil should be slightly damp, never wet);
you keep an eye out for pests.

If several leaves are turning yellow (rather than brown which would suggest under-watering) and falling at the same time, I think this may be caused by over-watering; it is worth checking whether your container is delivering the right amount of water..
There is a very full article on growing gooseberries in pots here.

1234,"I got a plant pot in my room, growing some coriander.

They are all over a lot of my plants, tiny little green dots!  Are they going to kill my plants?  They have spread to my chilli plants :(  They sort of make the stalk look textured and weird.


Are these aphids? They do cluster - especially around buds, where they can cause damage. An indoors infestation can quickly spread to other plants.
The organic method is a soap spray (never used it) - I use pyrethrum which is considered less harmful for food plants and delicate plants. You will still need to wash leaves/etc before eating, and be careful where you spray it.
For identification, the Wikipedia article has some photos. There are lots of different kinds of aphids, including ones which are 'farmed' by ants - you won't have those, but it gives you an idea of the diversity.

Chives, Oregano, Cilantro, Mint, Basil, and Parsley all grow well as a companion to tomatoes.  Some such as the Basil and Chives are said to enhance the flavor of the actual fruits as well but most all of these help deter harmful pests (such as aphids, certain beetles, etc.) while also helping attract beneficial bugs.  Oregano in particular when it spreads out helps provide ground cover resulting in increased soil warmth too.  Mostly it will depend on your preference for what herbs you prefer or will use.

From a culinary perspective:

If you're planning spaghetti sauce, then plant basil, oregano and parsley. 
If you're planning salsa, plant cilantro.

That probably didn't need to even be said, but it seems to be the answer,  I don't think you should plant them in the same pot as your tomatoes though. If you had them outside in the ground, I'd say go for it (on the sunnier end of your tomatoes), but your tomatoes are going to wind up towering over your herbs regardless.

1261,"A question I often wonder about when watering outdoor pots in the dead heat of summer. Should I just make sure the soil in the bed/pot is watered sufficiently, or is it necessary/advisable to also water the leaves and stem? My naivete makes me think that hitting the above ground plant will keep the plant cooler and reflects more of what happens when it rains, but I may be wrong.


This depends. 
If your humidity level inside is too low (often a problem is you run the Heat or AC) then plants do benefit from a misting of water around the plant to try to raise the humidity in that area of the room.
However, mostly you just want to water the soil beneath the plant rather than the whole thing. This is because water sitting on leaves of plants, or excess humidity around them (especially things like tomatoes) can actually lead to disease. It also provides little actual benefit to the plant.
Most places outdoor plants will have plenty of moisture in the air to be just fine. However, if you are in a desert or other very dry climate you may have to mist around your plant so that the humidity around the plant stays at the proper levels.

Although some doubt was cast on it in an earlier question, there is the concept of ""scorching"". If this occurs (and isn't a myth) then the water droplets on the leaves act as small lenses refracting solar heat and scorching plants. Some plants are effectively immune, but if this does occur, other plants and growing buds might be particularly sensitive.
Another point against foliage watering on outdoor plants, is that the water on the leaves will evaporate more quickly than if it falls on the ground (this is where @wax eagle's humidity comes from). It is therefore wasted. At times of drought you want to get all the water where it needs to be to minimize water usage (and your water bill!).

The holes definitely look like they are caused by some sort of insect (especially when taking into account your other pepper plant related question).
At the moment the problem doesn't look that bad, therefore if you wish to take an organic approach, you could just keep an eye on it, before treating (if the problem gets worse).
Have you inspected the plant thoroughly (including soil line & just below) in an attempt to see if you can find, see the culprit?

My weather: Hot during the summer (mid 90s during the day mid 70s at night). Some rain.


I think one issue with some herbs is that they don't want to be too wet; I'm not sure you want the self-watering container. I let mine dry out a bit before watering it. And they germinate and grow very slowly. I think I soaked mine overnight before putting seed in soil. The germination rate is very low.
Some info taken from this page:


Darkness will aid germination.
Cover seeds lightly after sowing.
Optimum soil temperature for germination is 60
  degrees.
Germination time 14-21 days.
Sow heavily because the seeds have a poor germination rate.
Some seeds can germinate up to 3 months after sowing.
Water in between dry downs; do not use enclosed planters...

Yes, I probably wouldn't be too worried - or not yet. I grow my peppers outside and this sort of damage is pretty typical.
Where I do get leaf-eating problems are with horn worms - a horn worm can fully defoliate a pepper plant on a day. Unfortunately this is when they usually get noticed because they are usually very camouflaged. The plant will grow back but of course that sets it back a few weeks. Tiny horn worms look like green inch worm caterpillars, and they grow to about 3 inches long and green.

As mentioned in other answers already, watering the foliage is mostly a waste of water due to evaporation.
One exception is if you are ""fertigating"" (fertilizing + irrigating) aka ""foliar feeding"". This is where you spray a dilute fertilizer mixture on the leaves so that the plant takes up nutrients from the leaves instead of through the soil. But this isn't really watering as much as feeding -- the plant isn't getting all that much water as compared to nutrients.

1276,"Is spent cat litter an appropriate source of nitrogen for compost?

The cat litter used is made of recycled paper pellets so is rich in carbon.
It doesn't contain the cat faeces because that is fished out once or twice daily with a net to make the litter last longer, so should not contain any significant source of pathogens.
It has quite a ripe ammonia smell to it (hinting it's rich in nitrogen, thanks to cat urine) by the time it's replaced in the litter tray, making me wonder if it could be added to the compost to hasten the breakdown.

If not good for compost, could it be useful anywhere else in the garden?


The usual recommendation I see for faeces and urine is not to put it on the compost due to the possibility of disease. Urine might also be a bit concentrated. From a disease point of view you should be okay if it gets hot enough. For the question of concentration, then you can use small quantities and dilute.
You say your litter is based on recycled paper (which should rot), but a lot of other cat litters use zeolites for their 'structure'. These should make a good base for soil/compost, although you may have to watch for any chemical treatments.

1281,"Was wondering what a typical duration of production for a conventional bush bean is.  I know a lot of factors such as how well the plants are cared for and heat can play into it.  Here in the Northeast US I've had a solid three weeks of beans out of a few different varieties and they all have pretty much stopped flowering at this point.  They are well cared for and get between 1""-2"" of water weekly however I think it may be time to pull them up and plant again.  Is three weeks of beans good or is it advised to stick it out and let them remain although they've greatly slowed?


Once flowering has ceased, the plant is pretty much finished.
To prolong the (plants) harvest period, pick the pods when they are firm and crisp, but before the seed within them has developed (matured). 
When you allow the seeds to mature within the pods, that really is the beginning of the end of the plant.
If you have the room (and wish to maximize your harvest season), it is recommended to plant several crops, 2 to 3 weeks apart, up until 8 weeks before your first average frost date.
I'm no bush bean expert, but I would say 3 to 4 weeks is a pretty good harvest period for those plants.

Bonus points for ""interesting to look at"". Cacti seem low maintenance and resilient, yes? What other choices are there that I might consider?


As well as cacti, I'd look more generally at succulents. When I was a kid, I loved growing lithops (living stones) just because they were so visually interesting. And, they positively reward neglect, as over-watering will cause too many leaves to form, which spoils their camouflage.
I also had a number of different forms of crassula, whose geometrical leaf patterns I loved (I always found a certain beauty in nature's expression of math!).
Finally, if the spines on cacti might make them unsuitable in places, how about something like euphorbia obesa? Suitably bizarre to look at and, again, nicely drought tolerant.

I'd say it depends a bit on what will be grown later. If you are putting the compost onto vegetable plots, especially vegetables that you are going to eat raw, then you need more care to avoid pathogens and such bugs. However, if it's going on a flower bed then I might worry less. Where I live - China - people open up cesspits and use human waste to fertilise plots, so cat poop has less to worry about than that.
The one thing that would worry me is the litter itself. It may be made of recycled paper but how many preservatives and other chemicals are in that paper? You might find that it doesn't readily decompose at all.

1287,"I've had a glorious display of foxgloves in my garden this year, but now pretty much all of the flowers have wilted and fallen. I don't particularly want to collect seed from the plants, but what should I do with the remaining flower spikes / plants?
Should I cut the spike off the plant near its base? And if I do, will the plant recover to produce another spike next year?
Or should I just get rid of the plant entirely and sow seeds now for next year's display?


Foxgloves are (in Seattle and England) very hardy perennials.  You can easily trim the stalk back to the base and the plant will come back fine next year.  The only thing I've ever had to be cautious about is the fact that foxgloves produce a large quantity of seed, and they have been pretty good about sowing themselves around my garden.  There are times when I've simply pulled up the whole plant when it starts to look a bit ratty, because I know that there is going to be a new crop of foxgloves popping up around the garden next year.  And that means that it's also easy to save up the seeds if you want more for next year or have found a particular variety or color that you'd like to propagate further.

Bush beans were bred to make mechanical harvesting easier, so they have a shorter harvest period than pole beans. 2-3 weeks is typical, so your 3 weeks sounds good.
As Mike Perry mentioned, you can plant successive crops a couple of weeks apart -- this avoids the problem (if you consider it a problem) of having a huge amount of beans arrive at once.
Also, if you're looking for a longer harvest, have space, and don't mind building some supports, most pole bean varieties will produce over a longer season. (And in my opinion they taste better.)

For instance, it has some sort of clover in the bag, and I have clover growing all over my lawn, but not usually in the garden, should I pull out half the clover in the garden?  
The packet also says to make sure the plot is weed free, but how can I tell if a plot is going to be weed free before the weeds grow?
So far the only thing I know to pull is grass...


Making a patch of ground ""weed free"" is standard boilerplate -- and useless.
Basically what you want to do is start the seeds in an area that has been cleared of sod and isn't full of aggressively growing weeds.
Hopefully the stuff in your packet grows aggressively and outcompetes whatever weeds are going to invade.
We have a sort-of butterfly garden. A minimal amount of effort goes into making it ""weed free"" -- especially since most of the ""flowers"" would be considered weeds by a lot of people. Many were pulled out of roadside ditches and transplanted here because they look nice. Everything grows vigorously, so it all outcompetes ""weeds"" for the most part. And all of them are perennials or self-seeders so they come back every year. Maintenance is really just a matter of pulling out the grass and hacking back whatever flower/weed (depends on your perspective!) is getting a little too aggressive.

I don't mind weeding it, although I would like to know that I am pulling out weeds. 
For instance, it has some sort of clover in the bag, and I have clover growing all over my lawn, but not usually in the garden, should I pull out half the clover in the garden?  
The packet also says to make sure the plot is weed free, but how can I tell if a plot is going to be weed free before the weeds grow?
So far the only thing I know to pull is grass...


While I'm not disagreeing with any of the information already give here, and I whole heartily agree that weed free is (near on) impossible, you may wish to read up on soil solarization for future reference, or at least be aware of this technique:

1303,"What's the best way to get warned if there's going to be a frost? Is there website or online service which will email me?
My priority would be a service which emails only in the event of frost warnings but I guess a year round daily email with min/max forecasted temperatures for my postcode would be fine.
I'm in the UK. I did sign up with one UK frost alert service before last winter (sorry, can't remember which one) but never received any emails. 


Wunderground.com have email alerts, but they might be limited to US servere weather warnings.
I use Wundergound for my weather - good for stats junkies such as myself, or those what want a meaningful discussion of hurricane forecasts rather than the usual TV gloss. However, I use their website (no advertising for $5/yr). They also have some broader international weather forecasts/data.

1305,"What kind of pepper is this and when will it be ""ripe""?
The peppers are a bit larger than a cherry tomato (maybe apricot size).

UPDATE: The peppers turn red after they ripen.


Peppers easily hybridize so it is possible you may never know, or it might be an obscure variety (My supplier lists 100 or so).
It looks like it is almost certainly a cultivar of Capiscum annuum (as are most cultivated chile peppers).
The closest match to anything I've grown would be Gypsy. This is a small yellow bell pepper that likes warm climates. Size and colour are a good match although they are not as spherical and nobly.
As to when it is ripe? Watch the colours - let a pepper ripen without picking and see where it ends up. You can eat it at any time - remember that green bell peppers and jalapeños are simply unripe peppers! As it ripens, peppers will tend to become sweeter. With yellow peppers, they tend to turn from a green/yellow to a purer yellow. The gypsies turn into more of a lemon yellow shade.

1319,"Is there an ideal or preferred shape for a trellis or cage for cucumbers?  
My plant is taking over my garden and I would like to get things a bit more organized.  I've seen a cone type trellis where it's narrow at the base and expands toward the top.  I'm just not sure if that type of trellis is ideal for cucumbers.


I've seen two styles:
The first style is an A-frame, with support legs in the back and mesh on the front. (Don't use chicken wire for the mesh -- I did this once and cukes would grow through the wire and then fatten up and get pinched!) I have used this style in the past with decent results.
The second style is vertical, with two tall posts and a crossbeam from which mesh is suspended.

1340,"Generally speaking, when watering a vegetable garden, are there any benefits to using cold water vs warm or vice versa? 
I'm in Wisconsin, so 90+°F is about as hot as it gets around here. Typically the temps are in the 80s during summer months. I'm mainly comparing water that has been sitting in a brown rain barrel in the sun (warm) vs water from a hose (generally cold).


I have been growing a wide range of vegetables for many years, and have never deliberately used warm water (although the water in the hose is sometimes warm after lying in the sun for a time); I very much doubt that there are any benefits at all in using warm rather than cold water, or vice versa, except with tender seedlings, before they are hardened off, when I always use tepid water. Soil and air temperature, of course, are critical to growth rate and success.

1348,"I planted a capsicum/pepper plant about 5 months back and it's been growing well and producing a few fruits.

I was hoping to keep it going through winter till next year.  Is there anything I can do to save it or am I too late?




I would pick the ripe fruits - this might give your plant a little bit more strength. however, these plants look like mine when I've grown them in pots and brought them in for winter. Most people grow them as annuals (and this is what I do with my raised bed plants, just letting the frost kill them).
I have had some mixed success over-wintering them in pots, although it is patchy and some years none survive. They seem prone to disease. Leaves fall off (as per yours), but as long as some green stem survives into spring, then you should be able to grow the plant again and get lots of fruit from it. I don't know if it makes a difference, but when I've done this, I've always planted the plant into a bed outside for the new year.

1349,"My mum has a plant (Aglaonema modestum) which she doesn't quite take care of, and it is messy with dead leaves and half yellow, half green leaves.
I find them very ugly and want to trim them off. The question is, should I trim off the half yellow, half green leaves from plants in general?


The answer depends on the size of the leaf in question. For e.g., if you have large leaves, then the stalk is going to be wider and so the cut (where you trim the leaf) is going to take longer to heal and could possibly get infected. On the other hand, for plants with moderate to small leaves (e.g., roses), there is no harm in trimming off a half yellowed leaf. 
I usually give such leaves a slight tug and see if it snaps off itself. If it does, well and good and if it doesn't, I wait for a couple of days and try it again. If it looks really ugly, I take the scissors to it.

The plant is already very tall and all you've got is trimmed branches, I think it is hard for the leaves to grow again from the trimmed branches. So the short answer is no.
I know trimming is all you can do for a weak plant. It is dying. Your might want to save the chili fruit and sow and the seed after winter. A new plant in Spring will be much stronger than a plant that survived winter.

1352,"My lawn is full of so much thatch that I can bend down and pull up handfuls. I used a steel rake to pull up some today but it is still full of thatch. I feel like I could continue raking for days and never get it all.  Will a rake meant specifically for dethatching be any easier to use, and more importantly will it pull up more thatch than a standard steel rake?


A standard garden rake doesn't remove thatch well at all. Either of the following tools would do the job much better:

A hand lawn rake/scarifier
An electric lawn rake/scarifier (Very effective - I use one myself)

You can see them here and here.

1355,"It's said that we shouldn't use manure when preparing ground intended for carrots. Is it that carrots don't thrive on manure, or is it that they fork and splinter too much?
What about other roots? Radishes, beetroots etc?


The root cause (no pun intended) is that excess nitrogen will make the roots fork. I've heard two different theories as to why:

""Hot"" fertilizer like fresh manure burns off the fresh roots and makes them fork.
A lot of nitrogen in shallow soil fails to encourage the plant to scavenge deep in the soil for nutrients, and they send out roots sideways instead.

Or it could be combination of the two -- but the latter came from a more reliable source and fits more with my experience. (One of my books versus something seen on the internet -- sorry I can't remember exact sources.)
Even in soil where I haven't added extra nitrogen but was very fertile with other nutrients, I have seen carrots develop not so much forked roots as fat sideways roots instead of the usual fine ""hairs"".

I was trying to identify a common shady non-native trees in the Adelaide parklands for ages, but found help at What Tree Is It where you can drill-down to more and more specific groupings by leaf or by fruit, using the pictures and descriptions provided at each fork.

Is growing trees from seeds as simple as growing anything else from seeds?


Start by making sure your seed are ""stratified"" (put through a cold period to simulate winter).
An example of stratification: usually started mid-February.

Essentially, you break the wings off the seeds, put them in a jar of
  warm water, and let them soak for a day, then you put them in some
  damp peat moss, sand, soil, etc in a plastic bag (with a few holes
  poked in it) and store the bag in your refrigerator for 90 days or
  until the seeds begin to sprout.
  - link

Then around mid-May (or sooner if they sprout in the fridge) plant them in a pot. 
The temperature and duration of Stratification depends on the climate your seeds like. See the link ""Stratified"" for more information on various trees' stratification requirements.

1373,"One of my pepper plants has started to flower, and the petals are falling off to reveal a pepper growing from that stem - well, at least the first two have, and the other flowers seem to be bulging somewhat in the middle and I assume will therefore produce fruit.
A second of my pepper plants are also flowering, but when its flowers drop off they drop off entirely, stem and all. So far three of its flowers have done this, and there are a few more flowers that don't appear to bulge like my more successful plant.
Should I be concerned about the second plant? And if so is there something I should be doing about it?


Peppers are self-pollinating, so in general if you see flowers, they should produce peppers. That said, if there is insufficient air flow around the plant or if it is in an enclosure, etc., it might not be releasing enough pollen into the surrounding air to fall on the stigma. 
You can try gently tapping the stalk of the flower or the branch that has the flower, so as to release a pollen cloud around the plant. That should be sufficient to pollinate the flowers.

1376,"Do you know what is the best soil for an avocado plant? Would it vary depending on the breed? What would be a good recipe for this soil (for growing indoors)?


As a long time avocado grower and fan of guacamole I was going to tell you that you can grow it in most soils. As with any plant proper watering and food will make a big difference. Since you are growing indoors I would suggest a quality potting soil that will have what the plant needs in the indoor environment. I would give it as much light as possible, preferably sunlight. Water only when the soil is dry and then water thoroughly. Feed during the growing season and do not fertilize over the winter. Can't guarantee any fruit, but you should have a nice plant to grow. 
"
1387,"Do you know what is the best soil for an avocado plant? Would it vary depending on the breed? What would be a good recipe for this soil (for growing indoors)?


Soil needs do vary a little between the three basic types, the Guatemalan, the Mexican and the West Indian; however, all three will tolerate most types of soil, but not wet feet; they prefer a light/ sandy potting compost (specially formulated for indoor plants) that is free-draining and will not take too long to dry a little between waterings (when it should be slightly damp to the touch but never wet). Garden soil, of course, is unsuitable for indoor plants, as it may not be sufficiently free-draining or balanced in nutrients, and also contains organisms that could thrive indoors and cause disease. A standard multipurpose potting soil, available from your local garden center should meet your avocado's needs, but I would try to avoid a peat-based one, as it loses moisture very quickly and, if allowed to dry out, is quite difficult to wet again.

1419,"I currently have a tomato plant planted in a pot on my porch. It is doing quite nicely and is tied to a 6' bamboo cane. Unfortunately my cane has started to lean a bit and I am afraid that as the plant continues to grow and eventually starts bearing fruit that the cane will not be able to do its job, or that the pot may fall over.
I am wondering what the best way to support the cane that is supporting the tomato plant? Or am I better off choosing a different support method for my potted tomato plants?


Nothing fancy, last year (sorry I don't have a photo to share) I did this with my two tomato plants, each in their own pot:

4ft or 5ft (1200mm or 1500mm) long garden canes.
Sunk the canes into the soil around the perimeter of the pot at about 4inch (100mm) centres.

Both plants seemed to like working themselves around the canes. I didn't have to tie them to the canes. And with that number of canes, the plants seemed to have more than enough support.

From the shape of the leaves and the smooth, glossy texture of the leaves, I would say it's some kind of Holly.
Or it could be something like:

Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium)
False holly (Osmanthus heterophyllus)

The secret of pulling any weed (plant) out of the ground (root and all) is to soak (via a garden hose) the ground really well beforehand, or go out there immediately after a really good down-pouring.
Then grab the weed (plant) firmly and as close to the soil line as possible, then pull slowly.
Once you've pulled a few inches of the weed (plant) out of the ground, move your hands back down the weed (plant), so you're once again grabbing it firmly and close to the soil line, then pull slowly. Repeat, repeat...

Pulling a plant with a very big tap root can be very difficult if not impossible. Water can help (I find it helps a lot with shallow weeds and grass), but you may well have to cut it.
Cutting the tap root as far down as possible with a sharp spade may be sufficient.
For good measure you could brush some ""bush-b-gon"" (woody plant) type weedkiller on the cut stem or root. This is usually sufficient to stop most things coming back and is extremely localized (ie. You won't kill anything else - unlike a spray).
"
1438,"In our backyard there is a bush growing up the side of a wall, using a drain pipe to crawl up.
Its trunk has grown to be relatively thick (~ 10 cm) and it is now causing the concrete to split on the floor. I'd like to remove it altogether. What's the best way to 'kill' it and prevent any more growth from the roots?


I'm not an arborist but my approach would be to cut it back as far as a possible, then to saw the trunk close to the ground. Paint a brush-b-gon (woody plant) type weed killer on the freshly cut surface. If the weed killer does not work and it starts sprouting, I have successfully killed tree stumps by drilling holes in the top and then pouring a copper sulfate/sulphate (CuSO4) solution in. CuSO4 is sold here in the US as a root killer (pour crystals in your drain, and it keeps tree roots in check without killing the tree); in the UK we used it in High School a lot as it was a very visible (bright blue) and relatively benign salt.
Once dead, the roots will slowly decompose on their own. A tree stumper could be hired, but a 10cm trunk seems a bit small for such an investment and getting under the concrete would be impossible without lifting the concrete.

1444,"I'm worried I might have planted my chilis too late. This is what they look like now, and there are 5-6 weeks left of summer here. Will they have enough time to produce chilies?



Where are you and when is your first frost?
Somewhere like here in Texas has summer through to early September. But that is when the peppers start to get productive, and I get my main harvest from September through to the first frost (they start to get a bit slow as the temperatures fall into the 30's°F to 50's°F / single digit °C).
The smallest plants in the rear pot (the seedlings) are too small. Your other plants look established with good healthy (deep green) growth. If you're not seeing flower buds yet then you will do soon (look in the crown area of the two largest plants). I think you're going to get some fruit - and depending on your weather, possible quite a few.
I find they do much better putting them in beds but it is probably a bit late for that to be particularly worthwhile.
"
1445,"My flat leaf parsley is not looking very healthy; the growth seems stunted, and the leaves are starting to turn a pale red. What should I do to revive it?



Parsley forms a tap root; it looks like the soil in your pot isn't very deep, so the root might not be developing properly.  You might be able to carefully lift the plant with root ball intact, put some more soil underneath it, then replace the plant.  This would give it the root some more space to develop.
Another possibility -- since parsley is a relative of the carrot -- is that it's being attacked by Carrot fly.  Prevention is your best defense here, see the Control section of the Wikipedia page.

1447,"My garden (first ever!) has been doing great. Yesterday I harvested my potatoes, which left half the garden open and bare. Some critter seemed to view this now-open landscape as an invitation to come and dine. 
Whatever it was, it ate all my strawberries and sampled many of my tomatoes. Left lots of tomato halves, both green and nearly ripe ones lying on the ground.
It's not a deer, because we had that problem earlier in the season, and I built a 6' fence which seems to be working. I'd recognize deer prints if I saw them. This creature left no prints that I could see.
Any idea what it could be, and what I could do to discourage its dining? I've seen a rabbit flee the area once or twice in the evening, but he seemed to be on the outside of the fence. If it's a rabbit, I could in theory secure the fence (it's a Polypropylene mesh) to the ground a little better. But if it's a squirrel, I imagine they'd be able to scale any kind of fence I put in.

1451,"Is spent cat litter an appropriate source of nitrogen for compost?

The cat litter used is made of recycled paper pellets so is rich in carbon.
It doesn't contain the cat faeces because that is fished out once or twice daily with a net to make the litter last longer, so should not contain any significant source of pathogens.
It has quite a ripe ammonia smell to it (hinting it's rich in nitrogen, thanks to cat urine) by the time it's replaced in the litter tray, making me wonder if it could be added to the compost to hasten the breakdown.

If not good for compost, could it be useful anywhere else in the garden?

1452,"When planting large plants, like trees or large shrubs, I've always dug a hole larger than the root ball, filled it with water, and then suspended the root ball in the water and used my hand to separate the roots as much as I could. I always thought that this encouraged the roots to push into the surrounding soil and get a good hold rather than the roots circling round and round the ball formed when the plant was in the pot.
Are there other tips on how to ensure the survival of plants when they are being planted or transplanted?


You may additionally find the information given in this answer, ""How and when to plant young grafted apple tree?"", to be of some help, eg

Measure from the bottom of the plastic wrap to the top of the soil. That is how deep you want to dig your planting hole. Planting trees too deep will lead to major problems down the road. The trunk flare should be just visible once the tree is planted. Dig the hole twice as wide as the root ball that is currently wrapped in the plastic.

1455,"When I water my potted peppers, they all get pretty much the same amount of water, as I have a small jug that I've discovered provides just enough water to soak through the soil and just start seeping out the bottom of the pot.
Well, at least this is the case for 3 of my 4 plants. One of them seems to hold less water than its peers, because when I give it the same quantity of water, it ends up with much more water in the dish under the pot. I get the same result even if I wait longer between watering sessions, and there's no ""flooding"" on top of the soil, so I don't think it is a case of that pot being over-saturated.
Also, the plant itself seems healthy and has started flowering in the last few days (it's the third of the four to start) and is of comparable size (in height and leafiness) to its peers, so it seems to be keeping up, it just seems rather strange that it takes less water.


Your plant have a soil with good drainage ability, that is the reason why the water come out of the pot so quickly. Actually this is good because too much water retained in the soil is bad for the plant most of the time.
The drainage ability of the soil depends on the ingredients of your soil. Soil made of sand, peat, stone, vermiculite, etc has good drainage ability.
Don't worry about the plant.

I agree with gunbuster: as all four plants seem to be flourishing, I don't think there is anything to worry about. However, if you used the same potting mix for all of them and, in the one pot you describe, the water is running straight through the soil, without thoroughly rehydrating it, the plant may be pot-bound (i.e.its roots are filling the container and it needs to be moved into a larger one to remain healthy); if the soil has shrunk away slightly from the sides of the pot, leaving a narrow gap, this is definitely the case.
If your potting mix is peat-based (and you have good drainage), I would pour several jugs of water over the soil each time, to ensure that it is thoroughly wet, as peat dries out very quickly and is hard to wet again.The soil, between waterings, should be slightly damp to the touch, but never wet

Following on from Paul's diagnosis, I would add that a potash deficiency often predisposes roses to Blackspot, so I would give them a feed with a high potash content, and spray them with Dithane - see here - every fortnight. They need to be treated promptly, as several successive outbreaks could cause stem die-back and kill them.

1469,"Consider a project like the Earthship. Supposing one would like to grow food (organic polyculture) indoors in such a habitat (i.e. in a green house). How many m² would be required to feed one person yearly?


This is not a precise answer to your question, but Lolo Houbein in 'One Magic Square' claims that 1 sq metre (9 sq ft) can provide 1 salad meal per day for two adults (or smaller side salad for three) all year round, through the application of companion planting techniques.
If you extrapolate this idea (and eating only salad three times a day) 3-4 sq metres would be enough to completely supply the diet of two adults. Of course, stuff like pumpkin and watermelon cover huge areas so if you had only this small a space certain things would be excluded from your diet.
So, even though it's not a precise answer I hope it could be helpful for others reading the question, who are trying to grow all their salad/vegetable needs in one backyard, not necessarily grow enough to cover their entire diet.

There are a lot of cheap secateurs on the market these days - especially from the big box stores. It is worth investing in a quality pair with a good sharp blade, good sturdy pivot (fulcrum), a safety catch that is easy to apply, and that feels comfortable in your hands. A quality pair will last you many, many years. A cheap pair might last a year and be dangerous.

1489,"French beans (or ""green beans"") are widely sold in both dwarf (bush) and climbing (pole) varieties. If anything, my experience is that the climbing varieties are harder to find in seed outlets.
Apart from the obvious the difference - dwarf plants take up less space and you don't need to support them - are there are any other differences?
For example, flavour, heavy cropping, choice of varieties, length of cropping, environmental tolerances?
I'm assuming the dwarf varieties have been manufactured more recently (but I have no idea whether that's true). So is it possible that the gain in convenience has been at the expense of something else?


[Translating, I think french beans are what we in the U.S. call green beans; dwarf is what we call bush; and climbing is what we call pole.]

You're right that bush beans are a recent development: they make it so that mechanical harvesting is easier.
In my opinion, pole beans taste better.
Pole beans crop more heavily, or at least over a longer season. Bush beans typically only crop for a couple of weeks.
Being the older kind, I would suspect that there are many more varieties of pole beans, but I can't back this hunch up with any evidence.

As always, when we breed for a particular trait (size), we tend to lose other traits (flavor).

1490,"I grew two types of broccoli this year. One was monaco I think, and the other one I'm not sure about (maybe calabrese?).
We started harvesting the monaco more than a month ago and per this question we have been getting a good crop of secondary heads ever since.
But the other one has given us nothing at all in terms of secondary heads (nothing wrong with its maincrop). 
In neither case did they get anywhere close to flowering. Is the difference down to variety? Or is it something to do with how and when we harvested?


In my experience, it is definitely down to variety rather than harvesting; given exactly the same growing and harvesting conditions, some varieties produce a really good crop of secondary heads, others very few or none at all. 
I have  found Corvet to be a very dependable 'cut-and-come-again' variety - I've been growing it for three years now, and it hasn't disappointed me. Another good one in this respect is Chevalier; I haven't tried it myself, but having seen it on my allotment neighbour's plot, I would say it is every bit as good as Corvet.
Two other good 'cut-and-come-again' varieties, I'm told, are Green Magic and Crown Sceptre.

1495,"I have this stuff growing throughout my yard.  I live in Southern NJ, USA.  It seems to only appear Mid/Late July - August.  It grows in patches and if I don't pull, can spread pretty rapidly across the lawn.
It can be sort of ""sticky"" when I manually pull it from the yard. How do I control/remove it?



It is a variety of Spurge, mostly likely Spotted Spurge.
I use to have some of it in my cool-season lawn. Two cutting seasons of hand pulling it, has eliminated it from my lawn.
Is best to pull it out (roots and all) while it's still small, otherwise it will form a decent size mat & smother (kill) the grass.

1500,"I have a lawn that is growing more and more weeds as the days go by. What is the best method of tackling this problem and returning my lawn to its former lush and green self?


Many weeds like acidic soil, so it's likely a sign that your yard is probably getting acidic (probably from the rain). Run a pH test on the dirt to confirm. If it is try adding lime (often a lot of it).
"
1504,"I have a lawn that is growing more and more weeds as the days go by. What is the best method of tackling this problem and returning my lawn to its former lush and green self?


One thing that can help is to keep the grass relatively tall. Lots of people mow their grass way too short. The taller the grass, the less watering it needs and the less sun is getting to the seeds of the weeds. The other advantage is that weeds then tend to have to grow straight and tall, making it a lot easier to grab to pull out. 
"
1505,"I have been reading that spent coffee grounds can be used for fertilizer and/or composting and also came across this question on this site.  I have a compost pile in the yard that holds roughly two 33 gallon trashbags full of uncomposted leaves (i.e. freshly raked leaves from the yard).
Can I take my spent/wet coffee grounds out each morning and add it into the compost pile (I drink about 2-3 cups/day)?  How much coffee grounds should I add so that there is a balance between other stuff in the compost pile? If adding it daily is too much, should I limit my composting of the spent coffee grounds to less frequent intervals (once a week, once every two weeks, etc)?


See especially the third bullet of yoda's answer on the linked question. Adding coffee grounds (high nitrogen) will help balance out your mixture (i.e. leaves which are high carbon).
In your situation, you might consider ""holding"" the autumn leaves in a dry area (bin, bags, etc. -- esp. if you can shred them first), and when you add grounds to the pile cover with a thin layer of leaves and sprinkle soil or mature compost. Coffee helps the leaves break down faster, and the leaves provide carbon to balance the process.
Finally, if you aren't impatient, don't worry about turning the pile -- it will rot eventually.

1513,"My tomato plants are covered with tiny, pill-like growths on their stems, pictured below. They're about 1mm wide and 3-4mm long, and they're widespread on both stems and branches. I'm also getting an early rot that turns my tomatoes brown, which may be related.

What is this, and how can I get rid of it?


These are the tiny hairs on the stems trying to turn into roots, above ground; they are called stem primordia, and this is usually caused by high humidity, over-watering or prolonged rain - see here.
Generally speaking, this is nothing to worry about, and is best ignored; however, it can be triggered by root problems or disease, and given that some of your tomatoes are rotting, it could be a bad sign and worth looking into - see Blossom End Rot - here.

1536,"Back in the spring we cut down a fruitless mulberry and hired someone to come grind the stump.  When they were leaving they informed me that they poured a chemical into the hole where the remaining roots were to keep it finish killing the tree and keep it from trying to come back.  They said the chemical would dissipate in a few weeks and wouldn't cause us any problems.  We waited a little over a month and then worked a bunch of compost into the soil where the tree was and planted flowers.  We've planted two rounds of marigolds now, but everything we plant where the tree used to be dies within a week or two.  I wish I knew what they poured down there.  What should I do about this?



First, call the stump grinders and ask them what they used.
Then you can make a more informed decision:

Option 1: Wait. Depending on what they used, the potency will dissipate over time and you'll eventually be able to plant something in the area.
Option 2: Build up the soil above that area -- make a raised bed. Don't mix the new soil you add on top with the contaminated soil below.
Option 3: Remove 12-24"" of soil from that area and dispose of it. Replace with fresh soil and plant. Again, don't mix the new soil with the existing subsoil.
Option 4: Cover that area with stone mulch and pretend you didn't want to grow anything there anyway.

1545,"I had a tree taken down and the stump ground up.  I cleared a majority of the tree mulch and laid top soil, seeded, and put some hay on top.  It's been a couple of weeks and the grass is growing in really patchy.  It looks pretty bad.  It's been extremely hot lately, so I'm thinking it's probably not getting enough water.
My question is: should I rake up the hay, dig up what's currently there, and start from scratch?  Or should I seed on top of the existing patchy grass?  (I'll be sure to water more often this time around.)


If it's just starting to grow and coming in patchy, just give it time.  It will probably fill in. If after two months it's still offensively patchy, sprinkle more grass seed on the patchy bits.

If you only seeded your lawn, it could also be that the local wildlife (aka birds) have come in and swiped some of your seeds, despite the hay.
Another option you could try, along with the seeding, is to take small ""plugs"" from other parts of the yard and plant them in the spot you're trying to grow. This has the benefit of taking established grass with roots and putting it in a new spot. The spot where you took the plug from will regrow from the neighbouring lawn.

You may also want to add compost and some grass starter fertilizer.
Also during the first few weeks grass is very sensitive so you need to water a little very often.
During hot days that may be 10 - 15 minutes up to 5 times a day.
An added bonus of compost is that it holds water better than regular topsoil.

1561,"I planted some winter rye last fall to hold a patch of soil over the winter. Planned to mow it, but spring came, summer came, and I still haven't cut it down. It's got beautiful fat seed heads on it now.
How do I know when these are ready to harvest (as viable seed) so I can use them for future cover crops?


The seed-heads will turn a tan colour, this is an indication the seeds themselves are ready for harvesting.
The mature seeds within, will be tan or brown (depending on the exact variety).
The mature seeds will come away easily from the seed-heads when you ""gently"" grasp just below the seed-head and pull upwards.

1567,"I had an Aloe plant that had grown to about 10"" tall, in the shape of a miniature Christmas tree. It was potted in a small 8"" pot with two other succulents. Last night our cats broke the plant from the pot, leaving the roots in the pot and a small part of the stem. The plant is full and green.
Is there any chance of saving the plant or the roots or both?    


Don't despair, fortunately aloes, like most succulents, root very readily. The best way forward is to (A) take a leaf cutting and (B) plant up the broken stem, as follows:
A.

Remove a healthy leaf from the stem (with a sharp knife) and leave it to dry out for two or three days, until a thin 'skin' forms over the open edge;
Insert it firmly in some moist potting soil, to a depth about one third of its length;
Place the pot in a bright but sunless place;
Water sparingly - keep the soil moist but not wet;

B. 

Repeat the last three steps using the broken stem, inserting it to a depth of 3-4"".

Provided you don't over-water, your cuttings should take root by mid-September, and you will have two 'new' plants by next Spring.

1569,"I want to harvest the seeds from a Coriander/Cilantro plant. I would like to pick them now, but investigation on the internet suggests that I should let them dry on the plant. Why?
The plant has bolted so I would like to cut it back to encourage new growth.



The longer you can leave the seed-heads on the plant the better (IMHO).
Q. Why?

You want the seeds inside to fully develop, become mature before harvesting ie Gain maximum flavour, and this can only be achieved by leaving the seeds on the (living) plant.
Immature seeds will taste bitter ie Not what most people want from their Coriander seeds.
The seeds are fully mature, ready for harvest, when the seed-heads start to turn brown. As soon as you see this happen (it's best to keep a daily eye on this to occur, as you don't want the seeds falling from the seed-heads under their own steam), either harvest the whole plant or just cut the seed-heads off.
If you allow the seed-heads to ripen too much

After harvesting you will need to dry the seeds, please let us know if you require information on that part of the process.

Chances are picking the seeds once it's gone to seed isn't going to actually encourage new growth.  If you're not interested in the coriander spice then you might as well try picking off the seeds and flowers to see what happens. 
The seeds dry on the plant and you pick them when the plant is dried, you can either leave them in your garden to pick them or hang'em upside down and dry them.  I don't think the seeds in your picture will dry out properly if picked though, they usually turn brown on the plant.

1574,"I currently have a tomato plant planted in a pot on my porch. It is doing quite nicely and is tied to a 6' bamboo cane. Unfortunately my cane has started to lean a bit and I am afraid that as the plant continues to grow and eventually starts bearing fruit that the cane will not be able to do its job, or that the pot may fall over.

Add another cane =) (or stick) 
Adding a cane inside the pot should reinforce the first one and prevent mechanical failure. 
This doesn't address the issue of the pot becoming top heavy and unstable. If it looks like it might fall over, add another cane (or two) so that the cane(s) rest on the ground outside the pot and counteract the instability.

While on a plant forum I stumbled across a method of using string to support tomato plants. I have not used it but it sounded promising: Link to String Discussion 
I found the following quote at the above link:

If you are using string in a greenhouse then the best way is to tie
  the string in a loose loop around the base of the tomato plant, then
  wind it anti clockwise round the tomato and take the string to the
  wire and tie it with a loop, if you leave plenty of string at the top
  then as the plant gets close to the wire you can undo it and lower
  the plant down a couple of feet so that the bottom which has cropped is
  on the ground and the plant has more room to grow up. Well that's how
  we used to do it in the old days, I must have strung many thousands of
  tomatoes in my time. David

1579,"I plant maincrop potatoes every year. Last year, I planted 50 Desiree in mid-April, in the usual way (15"" apart, in rows 2' apart, in light, sandy soil that had been conditioned and fertilised several weeks earlier), and I harvested them in August. The yield was higher than usual and they all looked very healthy; however, their texture, when cooked (steamed), was very disappointing: extremely dry and crumbly - so dry that they were only fit to eat mashed with butter. Has anyone had a similar experience and, if so, do you know why this happens? We had a prolonged dry spell when the tubers were forming, and I am wondering if I failed to water them sufficiently..


This year a standpipe was installed close to the plot where I grow my potatoes, so I was able to water them in depth throughout the dry spell. I grew the same variety as last year, and prepared the soil in exactly the same way.
I lifted some yesterday and steamed them; they are all very healthy, cook well and have a fine waxy texture - quite different from last year's which were so dry and crumbly.
JohnH was right: last year's crop simply needed more water.

My friend said that his lawn does that pretty much every year and they will eventually fill in once it starts raining again.
I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to either prevent or lessen the cracking in my lawn.  Also, could these cracks potentially cause a foundation issue?


I used to live in Texas and I know just what you mean. :)  Keeping the ground moist is all you can do to try to prevent it.  As far as your foundation goes yes it can cause some serious problems.  the only thing that you can do to prevent it is to water around your foundation.  Make sure that you are not starting to develop cracks in the ground around your foundation because it could cause the foundation to crack and sink into the whole from the graound.  I am sure you have been in many homes out there where you can see cracks in people's sheetrock and cieling.  That is what causes that.  It can also be very expensive to repair.
I would make sure that you water around you foundation at least once a day durring your killer dry spell.  If Dallas county puts a watering band into effect (which they will do i am sure)  Screw the grass and water around that foundation.

1597,"My cabbages have been growing strongly, but until recently mostly big loose leaves, not hearts. 
Now they're beginning to heart up, but some way up the stalk and off the ground (about 12-15cm up the stalk, possibly more [photo probably shows the most extreme example]). 

They look like decent hearts.
But is this a problem? In a lettuce (which I am more used to growing) this would look like a plant that had started to bolt. And also, archetypal illustrations of healthy cabbages always show tight balls close to the ground.
Edit:
Further thought: Could it be connected to overcrowding and/or being shaded by nearby beans and broccoli? Are these guys reaching up for more light?


My cabbages, for whatever reason, seem to all do what you're describing. (A picture of yours would confirm if they're the same as what I have.) They end up with a stem a few inches long (10-15cm) and then a good head (heart). Nothing to worry about.

The cracking is from the clay.  Texas soil has a lot of it, which is why we can't have basements, why it's so hard to dig, etc.  It grows and shrinks, depending on water content, much more than soil that has higher organic matter or sand content.  Your only two options are either to water it or to sprinkle top soil/compost/whatever on it... anything to get the clay content down.
As Mike Perry says, keep your grass long (2-4"".)  Cutting it short (i.e. <2"") is a bad idea in the summer.

So I harvest my beans (even if only to throw/give them away) regularly to prolong cropping.
How thorough do I need to be? Is it sufficient to regularly pick most of the beans that are ready or do I have to ensure I catch every single bean pod?


This is a good question. I have to admit that, so far, I haven't been brave enough to allow any pods to reach full maturity. In my experience, however, it isn't necessary to harvest every single bean pod before it begins to ripen. I usually harvest mine every few days, for about six weeks, before the beans inside have begun to swell, and I've found that if I miss the odd one that is less visible, and it begins to ripen before I spot it, this doesn't switch off flowering; however, I only ever miss two or three at the most (not all on the same plant), and I imagine that if more were allowed to start ripening or reach full maturity, the plants would stop producing.

1622,"One of my pepper plants has started to flower, and the petals are falling off to reveal a pepper growing from that stem - well, at least the first two have, and the other flowers seem to be bulging somewhat in the middle and I assume will therefore produce fruit.

Should I be concerned about the second plant? And if so is there something I should be doing about it?


After the suggestions here regarding pollination hadn't helped I continued to research, and apparently it seems that over fertilisation can cause an excess of foliage growth and delay fruit production.
I originally ignored this as a possibility - I wasn't feeding the plants - but then the plant in question (and the one next to it) continued to grow much, much, taller than the flowering plant. After a little investigation it turns out we'd had a minor miscommunication at home and the plants had been given more feed when it wasn't necessary, so this looks to be a potential cause.

Another thing to consider is the fact that your garden might eventually contain strawberries, horseradish, garlic, kale, onions, asparagus etc... some things you might want to keep from year to year. 
This will reduce the tillable area in your garden by quite a bit. 
Also, in the spring, you might wind up with parts of your garden that are too wet to till and parts of your garden that don't even need all that much tilling. 
For all this and more, a gas powered mantis sort of gizmo is the best option in my opinion. Even if you get a big tiller down the road, you'll still be able to use the mantis to work up the bed after your spring crops.  
In your smallish garden, you're probably not going to leave enough room between rows to run a big tiller, so you'll at most get one use out of a big expensive thing in your garage.

Mom hears tale that peppers turn red if you don't pick them from the plant. Is this fact, will the pepper change color when left on the plant past its full growth? Is this only for particular breeds of pepper? If it does change color, is there a specific length of time I should wait, or perhaps some way to tell when the color change is complete?
†The card doesn't clarify much past that. Just says ""pepper"" matures in ""60-100 days"", and talks about both mild peppers and hot peppers.


Green peppers are ""unripe"" (even though we often eat them that way). They get their final color -- red, orange, etc. -- as they ripen.
So your mother is right: if you leave them on the plant to ripen, they will turn the red color shown on the card. It sounds like the card was generic for all capsicum annuum, 60-100 days is a pretty wide range... if you knew the named variety of pepper, you could get a better idea of when to expect it to fully ripen.
And as they ripen, they develop their full flavor. (I.e. red sweet peppers are sweeter than green, and red hot peppers are hotter.) If you keep picking the green peppers, the plant will produce more fruit. If you allow the fruits to ripen to red, the plant thinks it has fulfilled its mission in life by creating seeds for another generation, and stops setting more fruit.

I own a pretty large tiller.  The next step up would be a garden tractor with an attachment.  Until my wife started farming on large property we really didn't use it that much.  One thing to consider in the equation is the maintenance costs.  If you hardly use it it might not be cost effective.  A neglected machine is a maintenance issue. 
Renting is a good idea until you discover that you are going to use it more than once or twice per year.  Or better yet, become friends with someone you can borrow from.

The above answers are correct, and ripening on-the-stem is always preferable, but it is possible to ripen them after picking. As @yoda points out, they do tend to shrivel and dry, but this might be desirable (eg. In a dry environment, you could do this as a precursor to making chili powder). However, the ripening process can be speeded up by putting the picked peppers with some ripening bananas. Both use an ethane ripening mechanism. So a ripening banana will give off ethane which promotes ripening in the peppers. It is the same mechanism that causes multiple bananas to ripen quickly when they are in a plastic bag. I haven't tried putting peppers and bananas in a plastic bag together but that would be the next logical experiment.

1671,"I frequently see small trees staked with some support twine or rope, presumably to aid against strong winds.
However, I've heard or read somewhere that staking small trees can actually be harmful, preventing them from building a natural resistance to the wind (in trunk strength, root development, etc.).
There are many guides that explain ""proper"" tree staking. Here are a few examples:

How to Stake a Tree
Staking Trees

It seems, from aggregating information in such guides, that staking is sometimes necessary, but that people often do it wrong.
The question then, is how do you determine when to stake a tree (if at all)? Are there lots of oddly bent or fallen trees somewhere from lack of staking? I've never seen one.


Below are a few things I've picked up over the years:

Location.

It's generally recommended to stake trees planted on slopes and/or windy locations.
If a tree is planted in a well protected area (and on flat ground) staking shouldn't be necessary and is in fact discouraged ie Let the tree develop naturally.

Staking should not hold a tree so rigid that it can't ""sway"" a little bit.

Swaying encourages a thicker trunk and a stronger root system.
Which ever method is used to stake a tree, it should not cut into the trunk. Any sign of such behaviour should be immediately corrected.

Staking is not needed or should be removed once a tree trunk is approximately 3inches (75mm) in diameter.

1686,"I've been trying to find out what weed this is (see photo), but I can't seem to find a definitive answer.
The weed mainly grows in the hedges of the garden, and appears to be choking it. It twists up the stems of the hedges like a vine. One hedge has already died completely because of this weed.
I've been cutting it off at the stem, but the weed is very deeply rooted and is very hard to get rid off. Does anyone know of any (ecological) ways of removing this weed permanently?




Not even knowing what the weed is I would recommend one course of action. What I would do is first find the weed where it comes out of the ground. Then cut it off about a foot or so above the ground. If there any leaves left spray or paint them with Round Up or other applicable herbicide. If there are no leaves just wait for some leaves to appear and then treat them. I would remove all the dead vines from the plant to help prevent seeds from falling. After you have done all that keep an eye out for any new seedlings getting started. Those should easily pull out by hand. That should take care of it. Good luck.

This looks very much like a Hop plant  (Humulus), a vigorous twining climber with  coarsely serrated (toothed) leaves that have three to five lobes. 
Hops are difficult to eradicate, even with a weedkiller; a neighbor of mine has several on his vegetable plot and has unsuccessfully been trying to remove them, without resorting to chemicals, for several years.
Unless you're willing to take the chemical route - you could spray their leaves with Roundup before they flower - the only options are probably hand-pulling and continually cutting the stems down to ground level to weaken their root system, or turning the hops to good account by using them for home-brewing ;)

1688,"Are chili plants an annual plant? I have read on the web that they are perennials. But mine have never lasted more than a year.


Technically, they are perennials, but they tend not to do well over winter. I have managed to over winter them. But I have to grow them in pots and bring them in (to avoid frosts), and then they grow slowly and seem prone to disease, lack of sun, etc. Hence most people (including myself now) grow them as annuals.
"
1692,"If you want that very welcome leek crop in mid-winter, you have to start thinking about them early on in the spring growing season. They're such a long time in the ground. Well, I got mine in on time but I've been neglecting them ever since. Next door's chickens paid a visit and damaged some patches of leek seedlings so I threw in some optimistic late sowings to fill in the gaps. Later some thinning was required but I left it rather late.
The result is a row of leeks which range from OK to severely undersized (some less than 0.5cm, many less than 1cm). Is it too late (mid-August) now for these feeble looking plants to swell up in time for a winter crop? 
And when exactly do leeks slow down and stop swelling? At what point later on this year should I stop looking for progress and just be happy what I've got?


I've had a similar problem with my leeks this year. I sowed them on time but, soon after they germinated, went away on holiday for three weeks and on my return found that they were smothered in weeds. I hand-weeded the plot promptly and later transplanted all 120 (backbreaking!), but they are still very puny - about the same size as yours. 
Leeks require about 90 days from thinning/ transplanting to maturity, so if we have a mild autumn and you enriched your soil before planting, your leeks (and mine) should have ample time to swell up before they're lifted. If I'm not mistaken, you live in the south of England, where it's warmer, so yours will probably catch up better than mine ;)
"
1699,"Is it 100% safe to handle the soil by bare hands? Would any toxic insect hide inside the soils? 


Insects are rarely a problem. The only one I can think of that might bite in soil, would be ants.  Also avoid the blatantly obvious like digging into wasp/hornet/etc nests!
I think you are probably thinking of bacteria and other microbes. Generally you will be fine, no problems; but beware of animal (and human) urine and faces contaminating the soil. Also use gloves if you have cuts - this is how tetanus (a virus) spreads. Or just have your tetanus vaccination.

1703,"Gardening guides, when discussing rhubarb, will always illustrate their advice with a picture of some fancy forcing jars, or else reclaimed old-fashioned chimney pots, which look great and add decoration to the garden.

But man, are those things expensive. Does anyone have any tips for cheaper alternatives? Doesn't matter if it's an eyesore. 
Dustbins are sometimes mentioned but they're too large surely.



I'd probably use 5 gallon pails, we have a bunch of these hanging around.
(I think you have horses) How about a feed bucket or one of the larger watering buckets for the horses? (Especially if you have such a bucket that's been kicked/dropped/cracked -- since you said an eyesore is ok, a little duct tape will cover up the crack and exclude light.)
As far as dustbins go, a smaller office-size recycle bin doesn't seem like it would be too tall and they're inexpensive at your local office-supply store.

None of those are as heavy as the pottery will be, so put a rock on top to keep them from blowing around your garden.
"
1709,"I've seen many people in one of my local forums say that their purple basil turned green a while after planting. There were no proper conclusions to this problem, so could someone please explain?
In my own experience, I planted a purple basil from seed. It started with purple leaves until it was medium sized, and then its leaves started to turn green.


I do not have personal experience with this, but based on some discussion here it looks like the hybrids that generate purple basil can at times be unstable and revert to the traditional green basil. 

The plant's hybrid parentage may cause its genetic instability when grown from seed; leaf color often varies from plant to plant and large numbers of pure green plants maybe be produced.

Another possibility mentioned on that page is that they will sometimes revert if they do not get enough sun.
Finally from here there is at least one type of basil that starts out purple and turns green as it matures: African Blue Basil.
"
1717,"We have seen several questions recently about compost tea. We have also seen questions about manure tea and at least one question that referred to compost leachate as ""compost tea.""
What are the differences between these products/concoctions and how are they used? Are there any dangers associated with any of these products? 
A good answer should define and give uses for at least one of the following items 

compost tea
herbal tea
manure tea
compost leachate



What I saw referred to as Compost Tea as answers in this question was more similar to what I read was called ""Vegetarian Manure Tea"" (or maybe green manure tea) in Tips for the Lazy Gardener.  One of the keys to making manure tea is to make sure you use Composted Manure!  Hence the confusion.  If you don't want to get sick, it's best to call nothing at all manure tea and avoid the temptation to liquefy poop and spread it on your garden.
It's certainly good to make a distinction between Compost Leachate and Compost Tea.  I'd think that anything called ""Tea"" should be something steeped like herbal tea is. 
Although maybe in British English it should be called an ""Infusion"".

1722,"A week ago I harvested an orange Bell pepper from my garden. It was still halfway green, so I put it on our kitchen counter to ripen. When I finally cut it open for a salad after a week of ripening, it had a horrible ammonia smell, unlike anything I've ever experienced from a vegetable. Visually, there was nothing wrong with it, but the smell was a clear sign that something was rotten.
What can cause an ammonia smell from a pepper?


I'd agree with mfg that ammonia smell is highly uncommon (sure, the smell of rotting stuff is puke-worthy, but not close to ammonia) for a bell pepper plant. 
The primary way in which ammonia is released into the atmosphere naturally is by putrefaction of living matter. Anything that contains proteins or amino acids (contains an -NH2 bond), when broken down, releases ammonia (NH3). Although wikipedia lists proteins as being 0.86% by weight of a bell pepper, it is possible that your variety (or this particular one) had an excess. 
So, combined with other coincidental factors such as infection of the plant, lack of proper air circulation once outside the plant, anaerobic microbes, etc., it is possible that ammonia was actually produced, although the chances are slim.

1729,"I have started to grow moss indoors and am looking for more advice.
I saw some information online, but I am hoping to clarify some points here.

Do I need to put soil in the jar?

Also, are there health concerns with growing moss indoors? Can the spores be contained if grown in a closed glass container?

1734,"Recently we relocated a cactus into a new flowerpot. When it was planted the soil would evenly occupy the flowerpot and adjoin the flowerpot side walls. The soil isn't cactus soil, but just regular soil that we bought from a local shop.
Now the soil shrank, formed a stiff cylinder and that cylinder no longer adjoins the flowerpot side walls - there's about 10 millimeters of air on one side of the soil cylinder and the other side seems to have slanted onto the pot side wall.
The cactus looks just fine.
Is that a problem? How do I address it? Do I loosen the soil or should I just leave it untouched?


I've seen this happen with soil mixes containing peat that dry out. It may happen with other potting media too. The problem is that when you want to water, most/all of the water is going to just run down the side and not be absorbed by the soil. The preventive measure is to never let peat dry out -- which is possibly more water than your cactus wants. Backing up a step, it would probably be better to use a more appropriate soil mix.
I know nothing about cacti, so I'm not sure if this will be good for the plant, but re-wetting soil that has dried out that much can be hard. Assuming the pot has drainage holes in the bottom, you can place it in a shallow tray of water until the soil has reabsorbed enough moisture to expand back to normal.
If possible, you may want to repot into a potting medium that's more appropriate for cacti -- i.e. soil that can get dried out without contracting.

1751,"After cursing all the slugs in my yard and removing the few that I could catch, I was quite shocked yesterday to discover 100+ young plants all chewed to the ground.
I was going out at 9 - 10pm to find the slugs but was only seeing one or two per night.
Last night I went out at 12:30am and noticed just under 10 millipedes having a feast in what was left.
So how can I do battle with millipedes? I know they stay just under the surface during the day. My patch is heavily utilized so I don't want to remove everything to deal with them.


Fortunately, I have never had to do battle with millipedes, so I can't suggest a remedy based on personal experience. However, a quick online search has come up with this article which suggests the following control measures:

Remove as much garden debris as possible, since this is an ideal breeding ground for them
Drench the soil where they are with an insecticidal soap
Wherever possible, dry out damp areas
Hand-pick them off your plants and soil

1756,"Something has been eating my tomatoes just as they begin to ripen. Each day I've been finding one or more tomatoes half-eaten but still attached to the vine. On a couple of days I've also found bits of tomato skin scattered around a wooden chair a few feet away from the tomato plants.  
I haven't seen the critter(s) in the act. I'm guessing it's a squirrel, as we have lots of them in the neighborhood, but it could be some other small mammal.
I've grown tomatoes in the Sacramento region for years and this is the first time I've had this problem. Does anyone have any ideas on whether it's likely to be a squirrel or some other animal? More importantly, is there anything I can do to keep the critters away?
Update: I've selected a ""best"" answer, but please feel free to add your suggestions if you have a better idea. I'd love to find a way to deter the tomato-eating critters without going to the trouble of enclosing my tomato garden in a net.


I sprinkle cayenne pepper on the fruits and around the base of the plant, and this seems to keep the squirrels away.
Cayenne is also available as a ""hot pepper wax spray"" which may also work.

1758,"A few of my peppers are, it seems, suffering blossom end rot - first identified a week or two ago - this is based on the descriptions on the condition elsewhere on the site, but here's a few pics to help confirm:



From what I read on here, and in other locations on the web, the afflicted fruits can't be ""cured"" of this state; any damage done is permanent. So:

Is an afflicted fruit ever salvageable (for the purposes of being eaten)?
Should I be removing afflicted fruit from the plant as soon as the condition is noticed?
Or should I wait for a certain level of severity before acting?
Or maybe there is some obscure benefit to leaving the fruit on the plant?



Yes, this is blossom end rot. The fruit is salvageable since BER is a disorder and not a disease, but there is no particular benefit in leaving it on the plant, in fact it is better to remove it:

By giving sufficient water to the plants, BER can be
  reduced or eliminated. Pick off any affected fruits
  because they will not recover and will only drain
  moisture and calcium needed by healthy fruit. It is safe
  to eat the undamaged parts of fruits with Blossom End
  Rot. Merely cut away the blackened part.

1760,"I have 4 small chili plants (sorry not sure what variety they are), they have 3 sets of leaves. I re-potted them from a seed tray about 2 weeks ago. I'm a bit concerned the plant pot is too big? When growing from seeds how many times should I re-pot and into what sizes?



To me that pot looks about big enough for 1 plant. And only with daily watering care if it is hot. Even if that many plants ""work"", you won't get more peppers from them than from 1 big healthy plant.
I usually repot once directly to my main growing locations. I may put left overs into medium sized joghurt cups to give away or repot again eventually, but there seems to be no difference in which plants do better.
"
1762,"I have low spots in my yard that I would like to slowly fill in.  This isn't anything big enough to constitute a truck load of dirt or anything. What can I use (either dirt or manure) to fix these spots?


The benefit of ""dirt"" is that it won't settle as much as manure, so you won't need to keep adding to it. But, depending on what ""dirt"" you use, it may be lacking in organic matter and nutrients. If you're buying commercial bagged soil, check the label to see what it has in terms of organic matter and fertilizer.
The benefit of cow manure is that it will provide those areas with lots of organic matter and nutrients. Horse manure has the same benefit, but comes with the problem that it can contain a lot of weed seeds.
Depending on where you live, soil and/or manure might be free for the hauling. If you have the choice of poor quality soil and manure, take a little of both and mix them. In my case, I have lots of free manure and not much soil, so I tend to fill low spots with manure. When they settle I add a little more.

As Mancuniensis' answer says, pick them as soon as you see damage and cut away the bad parts. 
One other reason for picking them immediately is that you don't want to leave spoiled/damaged fruit on the plant. This will let bugs get in -- they'll spoil the fruit completely (and could eventually cause harm otherwise healthy parts of the plant).

Yes you can eat them - just cut away the rot. Remove them for all the reasons already given. Also the rot will only grow - so you might as well salvage the pepper whilst you can. 
Another reason is that too many fruit on a plant can restrict future fruit formation - so you might as well remove the ""zombie"" fruit to give space for new, hopefully better fruit.

1777,"Are millipedes considered good or bad for plants? 
From wikipedia:

Millipedes are detritivores and slow moving. Most millipedes eat
  decaying leaves and other dead plant matter, moisturising the food
  with secretions and then scraping it in with its jaws. However, they
  can also be a minor garden pest, especially in greenhouses where they
  can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Signs of millipede
  damage include the stripping of the outer layers of a young plant stem
  and irregular damage to leaves and plant apices, the very top of a
  plant.



Although millipedes can be  quite beneficial in the compost pile, in that they help to break down the contents, they also feed on vegetables and can destroy seedlings, as you point out; the few, small benefits they confer are far outweighed by the the harm they can cause, particularly when their numbers are high - see Millipedes eating my vegetable seedlings .

1788,"I am growing sunflowers and they grow quite high, sometimes toppling over. What kind of support can I give to them in this case?


I currently have a wobbly sunflower tied with twine to one of the tepees for pole-beans I built from some saplings I cut. We had 60mph+ winds during a storm this past weekend and that sunflower is still standing. The ends of the stakes are just pushed 6"" or so into the loose soil.
I just tied on a bit of twine that I had laying around in the garden. The bug ugly knot in the back is where the tepee is lashed together. It's not terribly secure, but I'm not going to cry if we get hurricane-force winds this weekend and the worst that happens is my 7' tall sunflower falls down.

1792,"I've been given a few peppers plants a few weeks ago, which I'm now trying to grow inside, on my sunnier window ledges. While trying to find out how to care for them, most advice I've found seems to indicate that I should ""pinch out"" the top when the plant is ~30 to 40cm tall (the tallest is current;y about 30cm now, so I'll need to do something with them soon).
I understand why we do this, and think I know approximately what I should be doing, but I'm a complete novice and have never tried to do this before, and would rather not accidentally kill them early on.
So, exactly how do I pinch out a pepper plant?


I've never pinched out peppers, but when I pinch out small tomato suckers or the tips of basil (especially if I'm removing a flower), I literally use my fingertips to pinch the stem and it comes away from the plant.
However, if I'm pruning a thicker stem that I know isn't going to just pinch away from the plant, I will use scissors. This avoids a ragged/torn stem that is going to damage the plant and may invite disease and/or pests.
You can try pinching your peppers with fingertips. If you don't get a clean cut this way, go get scissors and snip just below where you pinched so you have a clean cut.
As with so many things, this is one of those activities that's easier when you keep up on it. Pinching suckers with your fingertips is quicker and easier than pruning stems with scissors.

1793,"I live in Minnesota, I have bulbs I dug up last fall. This spring was so wet and I was so busy, I couldn't get them in the ground. I realize it is really too late to plant them now. But what should I do with them? Some of the sprouted in the bags I was storing them in. Would they be okay for next spring? Should I plant them?
I did miss a couple last fall and they sprouted beautifully several weeks ago. Should I just plant them so they can grow next spring?


Without knowing what bulbs you have, I can only give general advice:

Remove and discard any that have sprouted.
Store the bag in a cool, dry, dark place over the winter.
Check regularly and remove any bulbs that have sprouted or are rotting.

You might have some that are viable next spring.

1794,"In the past 2 months, I tried to germinate some pepper seeds, but all of them failed. I used some tiny pots to contain the soil (don't know more about it; just black soil in general) and the planted the seed about 1 cm below the surface. I have placed nothing on the pot as cover and I water them with a watering pot once a day. The room temperature is about 29°C (84°F).
What else should I do in order to encourage the seeds to germinate?


Water (as covered by bstpierre) is my first thought, and his comments about seed quality are good - this could easily explain very poor germination rates.
Which kind of pepper seeds? Some species cultivars are harder to germinate. Most varieties such as bell peppers, jalapeños, etc are in the easy category.
Soaking the seeds for a few hours in salt petre (Potassium Nitrate) is recommended for the harder to germinate varieties. I do this as a matter of course but should probably do a comparative test - I'm not convinced it has a great affect.
Finally, I plant at a much shallower depth, sprinking the potting compost over the seeds to cover them up. Due to vagaries of my technique and that I push exposed seeds in with a finger, some definitely end up 1+cm down and still germinate (I don't know what percentage germinate at this depth).
If there are any kids reading all this, the above could make a good junior science fair project!

1802,"I have a tomato plant that is now 6ish feet tall and still seems to be growing up and up. Is there a way to discourage this upward growth and keep it to a height that I won't need a ladder to harvest?


Unless perhaps it's a specialist variety then if it's 6ft then it has already put out more than four trusses - I presume. So you should have already pinched out the top to retard upward growth and force the plant to focus its energies on its fruit.
I work on the 4 trusses principle. However I didn't try to answer this question because I hoped for a more expert gardener than me to chip in and confirm it.

1803,"I have a tomato plant that is now 6ish feet tall and still seems to be growing up and up. Is there a way to discourage this upward growth and keep it to a height that I won't need a ladder to harvest?


Simply pinch out (prune) the growing tips. This will also help the plant put more energy into ripening fruit.

1806,"I am growing sunflowers and they grow quite high, sometimes toppling over. What kind of support can I give to them in this case?


I find that little bamboo stakes do nothing. You need a serious stake:  1/2"" to 1"" diameter and anywhere from 5' to 7' tall.  Tie the sunflower at several points along the stem. to reduce point stress.
All this will do nothing if you have squirrels around who think nothing of hanging off the seed head.  Damage from gale force winds cannot be prevented either.
Another approach is to trim the plant during the growing season of the side shoots which can add considerable weight to the plant.
Planting a smaller cultivar is also quite successful

1812,"Gophers or ground squirrels are common pests in North America, that can destroy the fruits of your hard labour. They create extensive underground tunnels and are mostly active at night. A typical gopher infested yard looks like this with mounds of mud and dirt piled up at the entrances to the tunnels.

What would be a good way to get rid of the gophers in a non-lethal way? I know that there are professionals who do come out, lay traps and kill them or you could buy some rodent poison at the local Home Depot/any gardening store. I'd like to know if there are alternatives to these because a) the first option can be expensive and b) I don't want to end up with a bunch of dead animals in my yard when I have no clue how/where to dispose them.


Below are a couple more suggestions:

Attract natural predators, especially birds of prey might be another option worth investigating a little more:

Attract hawks and owls into their area, by putting up a perch (roost) in the middle of the area. A simple cross beam ""T"" six or more feet off the ground will give those birds of prey a convenient platform to hunt from.

To prevent gophers (and other burrowing, tunneling pests) entering an area, a ""low"" level fence that is sunk (buried) into the ground 2ft (600mm) makes a very effective barrier:

If using a metal mesh type fence, spacing between wires should be no bigger than ½inch (12.5mm).

1814,"I had my soil tested last fall. As part of the submission I checked the box that said I use manure as a soil amendment / fertilizer.
In the results from the lab, they included a note that said that manure is a good source of many necessary nutrients, but it is not a good idea to rely on it as the sole source of nutrients over the long term.
Unfortunately they didn't say why. What's wrong with adding a bit of manure to my garden every year? (I have vast amounts of horse manure at my disposal.)


This question has been answered very fully. I entirely agree with most of the comments  and there is little to add; however, there is one important aspect of long-term/ over-manuring that has not been mentioned: soil pH. Regular use of manure, whether the cow or horse variety, will slightly lower the pH, and over-use will over-acidify your soil, just as too much fertilizer would, although to a lesser extent. Hence the need for regular soil testing. The increased soil acidity can, of course, be corrected by liming. 

Lowered pH. Regular manure application lowers soil pH. The acidifying effect of manure is less than that of inorganic fertilizers.

1818,"I've got a rock area around the back of my house that is getting overrun by weeds.  The reason the weeds are able to grow there is because the weed barrier has shifted some so there are gaps between some of the sheets, there are holes in it, and some soil has settled on top of the barrier and underneath the rocks.  I'm thinking that I'd like to replace the weed barrier to ultimately keep this under control, but I'd like to kill off any weeds that are there first before moving the rock and laying the barrier.
I've tried using Round-Up, but the weeds will usually come back within a few weeks.  I've also tried to pull them to keep them under control, but that's getting tiring.  I was thinking, since nothing is supposed to be growing there anyways, what if I just bake them out?  How would I go about doing this and what supplies should I pick up for this?


It all depends on the kind of weeds.  Annual weeds like dandelions can be baked out as Mike Perry describes.  Crown vetch seems to be far harder to remove and horsetails or equisetum are impossible to remove.
For annual weeds and perennial weeds of some types I recommend pool liner.    Whatever thickness you can get, just lay it down on the surface and cover with a mulch.  Leave for a few years and some of your problems are gone.

1822,"Is there any reason to avoid putting flowers purchased from the florist in compost?

We regularly put such flowers on the compost. Take care to remove any ribbon, wire, oasis, etc. None of that stuff will compost down.
Also a lot of cut flowers (eg. Roses) will dry to woody long material. They will break down much quicker if you cut them into 3-4 pieces first.

1824,"There are many books & websites which will tell me the optimal time of year to lay turf.
However, laying turf requires all kinds of preparation, plus you've got to coordinate obtaining the stuff and using it promptly. It's not an item that can sit around. So you can't do half the job one weekend and finish off the following weekend.
So you need to set aside a big old chunk of time. In my case that might be a time of the year when it's not optimal but still viable.
So my question is which months of the year are optimal, which are viable, and which are forget it. I'm in the south of England.


I have only ever laid turf once, so I'm no expert, but this is how I interpret the advice from Dr. Hessayon (""The Lawn Expert"") which seems pretty sound:

Optimal months in the UK are (in this order) early or mid-September, when the soil is still warm but there is little chance of a water shortage, October and November
Viable months are December to February, provided the ground is neither waterlogged nor frozen; also March and April, but this may involve regular watering when the weather is dry
to prevent the turves from shrinking and the roots from dying
'Forget-it' months are May to August - newly-laid turf would require frequent watering in the summer heat and would struggle to establish itself.

1830,"When is the best time to plant out a peach sapling?
I have been trying my hand at growing cuttings from peach tree prunings, and eventually(*) have one that is almost big enough to plant out. I'll wait until after the coming winter, but when is the ideal time? Presumably spring?  Should I plant it out before the leaves come out, or after?
(*) Two attempts. First mistake was the wrong time of the year. Also I've tended to use branches that are too thin.


You shouldn't plant the sapling when the ground is frozen or if it is too cold outside. The conditions would be too harsh for it to survive on its own. The ideal time would be after the ground has cleared of ice, when spring just sets in.
I can't talk from winter/ice experience, but I planted my peach sapling (about 1.5 ft tall; no leaves, only buds) out last year in late December in San Diego, when the temperature was around 10-15 C (50-60 F), no frost/ice/snow. By mid February, the plant sprouted leaves and by mid March, it had at least 6 peaches growing (which, I did not expect from a tree this young!). Now, it's about 3 feet tall and fully covered with leaves. The pic below is from mid March.

So it's more about how harsh/unwelcoming the conditions are outside than if the leaves have come out/not.

1844,"My tomato plant is about 6 months old and about a foot and a half tall.
How often should you prune your tomato plant during this stage? Is it possible to over prune  the plant? I usually use the pinch method of removing stems.
About my tomato plant. This plant is potted and it lives in the hot sunny weather in north Texas.


As a general rule, you can prune tomatoes every 7-10 days.
Yes, it is possible to over prune the plant. If you remove too many stems, you will reduce production. And you don't need to prune a determinate tomato -- they will stop growing at a certain height.
I wouldn't prune yours. At 6 months old, I'd expect it to be much larger than 18"". Is it fruiting? (Mine are about 3 months old and 4-5' tall.)

1845,"I want to plant a small size sinningia in my office. I read about the plant and found that it requires high air humidity.
How can I maintain a high air humidity in my office with a simple setup?


Really simple is a terrarium.  A small aquarium, 5 gallon or less, with a layer of drainage at the bottom  (stones for example), a soil separator (landscape fabric or new ladies nylons), and a tropical potting mix.
The key to success is a glass top for the terrarium which retains the humidity in the air. In fact with bright indirect sunlight your problem is more likely to be that fungal agents will ruin the flowers.   Simply take the top off to lower the humidity.
"
1849,"Is there any reason to avoid putting flowers purchased from the florist in compost?
The flowers were gifts but are now wilting.  Would florists or growers use anything on the flowers to preserve them that might be bad for compost?


The only reason not to that I can think of is that commercially produced flowers can have a lot of pesticide residue. Some of these chemicals may break down during composting. And unless you're adding a large amount of flowers to your compost pile (in terms of the ratio to other material) it will be diluted greatly by the rest of your compost feedstock. So it seems unlikely to me that it would cause a problem with the end product, but if you want to be absolutely safe, add the flowers to a compost pile that you won't use on edibles.

1854,"I've got a few giant sunflowers that are hanging pretty low.  I peeled off a few seeds around the outside just to see what they looked like and they look pretty big.  They're fairly light though, not dark like the seeds I planted or the seeds you buy in the store, and the seed inside the shell was really flat and almost gooey. 
How much longer do I have to go and when will I know they're ready to pick.  I'd like to roast them. Also, should I knock off the petals on the flower (does this help them not rot)?


Again with my go-to reference on all things seed-related, ""Seed to Seed"" by Suzanne Ashworth, p 87. You can harvest sunflower seeds:

When the head is completely filled out and the petals have fallen off,
cut it off and dry in an area protected from birds.
Remove the seeds when no longer soft or damp.
Using thumbs and index fingers, bend a shelled seed.

If it snaps in two, it's dry enough for storage.
Most will need additional drying.
Dry in a 1"" layer in a basket in a warm area out of direct sunlight. (And safe from those pesky birds, and possibly mice!)


I wouldn't knock off the petals -- they serve as an indicator it is ready as noted above.

Harvesting and storage

Sunflower is ready to harvest when the back portion of the head turns brown. The seeds actually mature somewhat earlier, but the head will be too wet for efficient harvest until the brown color appears. Timely harvest is important to minimize losses due to birds and late season diseases.

You may also wish to read the complete document that the above quote comes from:

Sunflower: An American Native

Personally I wouldn't spend the time removing the petals, as I don't believe it will have any effect on the developing seeds ie It will not speed up the process.

1856,"(Asiatic Garden Beetles are a new pest in the mid-atlantic and northeast US.  They look like a smaller, cinnamon-colored European Chafer, the size and shape of a coffee bean.  The grubs do the usual grub thing.  The adults are nocturnal and feast on vegetable and flower foliage.)
We're in NH, and are going to lose our basil plants if I don't come up with a way to control these things (adults) within a few days - they are defoliating the plants.  I'm thinking to put row cover over the plants, but I want to be sure I'm going to be keeping the beetles out - not in!


I made bags to go over the plants out of window screening, using carpet thread for the seams.  It worked well.  I tucked the mouth of the bags an inch or so into the dirt.  After three weeks or so, I removed them.  The beetles didn't return.
I think a very lightweight row cover - the kind that's purely for insect control - would have worked fine if used the same way.

1862,"I have Japanese knotweed growing into my garden from an adjoining neighbour's garden.
Does anyone please have any advice of how to get rid of this awful plant?
I'm in the UK.


It will keep coming in as long as your neighbor has it.
Patience and persistence will win, or at least get you to a standoff in the bad-neighbor case.  Roundup and digging work.  For full-grown plants, the root bole can be quite hard to get out - use a D-handle gardening fork, or even a pickax.
If you don't cut the plant first, Roundup often just stunts the plant, making it produce a lot of small foliage.  Dig it out then.
Even if you don't have the wherewithal to dig it all out, just keeping it cut down will slow it down a lot - don't just let it go because you don't have time to get rid of all of it.
"
1870,"I have a young apple tree (Spartan) with a small number of nice sized apples.
How can I tell if they are ready to harvest?


I am currently harvesting some of mine. I support the apple in the palm of my hand and give it a slight twist; if the apple is ready to harvest, it will separate easily from the spur.
Those that are not quite ready for harvesting often ripen very quickly, so it is a good idea to check the ground below the tree every couple of days, to collect up any windfalls before they start to rot.
"
1873,"French beans (or ""green beans"") are widely sold in both dwarf (bush) and climbing (pole) varieties. If anything, my experience is that the climbing varieties are harder to find in seed outlets.
Apart from the obvious the difference - dwarf plants take up less space and you don't need to support them - are there are any other differences?
For example, flavour, heavy cropping, choice of varieties, length of cropping, environmental tolerances?
I'm assuming the dwarf varieties have been manufactured more recently (but I have no idea whether that's true). So is it possible that the gain in convenience has been at the expense of something else?


Reviewing my crop this week, now that it has peaked:

Haven't detected a difference in flavour
Both types flourished
Climbing varieties have cropped much more heavily (by a factor of 3 or 4 times, possibly more)
However I am finding the beans of the dwarf varieties stayed at optimum size and tenderness for very much longer and have resisted overswelling and becoming stringy. Whereas the climbing varieties have rushed to produce outsized unusable beans

We use the beans whole as a tasty vegetable, so this last point is crucial for us. So my opinion of dwarf varieties has been revised upwards this year.

1874,"I planted some garlic this spring and I am now wondering when I should harvest it. (I planted them between 60 and 90 days ago -- not quite sure when I put them in.)
I pulled up one the other day and it didn't seem to have a head on it at all, just a stem and a very small collection of roots. 
What does the top of the plant typically look like when it is ready to be harvested?


I've been growing garlic for the last 2 years. You can plant them year round. 
You leave them until the stem wilts, falls over and turns yellow and generally looks dead.
Harvest them, plait the stems into a nice rope of garlic and leave them somewhere cool and dry to dry out a bit. You should then be able to brush the soil off the bulbs and hang them in the kitchen.
"
1891,"Is it possible that an instance of a plant could just be a dud. As in even with great care it is never healthy?


Through natural propagation (ie. seeds) sure - most mutations will be relatively benign (e.g. different color or different weather tolerances), but some are going to result in plants with low viability. Similarly, some are going to result in plants which are much better suited to their local environment. The bad ones die, the better ones do better. A cornerstone of evolution.
Propagation by cuttings (i.e. cloning) is a different matter as the clone is going to be genetically identical to the parent plant.

1893,"I obtained an orange tree a few months ago and it always seems to have a lot of problems. Curling leaves, yellow leaves and dying leaves. I am not looking for suggestions as to why I have problems here, but when talking to a person at a hardware store I was told that the tree was probably an indoor tree only and the heat was probably causing it stress. Other people have told me there is no such thing...
It said indoor/miniature Washington navel orange on the tag but also said that it could be outdoors. The sales person said that it's not really indoors but just miniature and that it needed lots of sun. Several other nurseries have also said there is no such thing as an indoor citrus tree that would not do well outside. So question is does such an a/c needing orange tree even exist? Could my tree be one of those?


Well, a citrus tree is not going to do well in a temperate climate. Eg. I've seen miniature kumquats and the like, do well indoors in the UK, but you'd never grow any citrus tree outdoors in the UK. In other words the indoor and outdoor climates can be so very different (incl. in Colorado) that ""no such thing as an indoor citrus tree that would not do well outside"" seems to be assuming a lot.
I see you are in Denver, Colorado. That isn't the kind of climate I would associate with citrus trees of any type! Regardless of the summer climate, you're going to have problems as soon as the first frost arrives.

We're in the dry and hot part of Washington state, and our miniature citrus trees are moved outside in the late spring, brought inside in the early fall.  They get regular (daily) water and direct sunlight, but they also get a chance to acclimatize before it gets too hot.  They are much happier outside and always lose leaves when they are brought in.  
Besides the regular water, make sure they get regular fertilizer.  Ours often get leaves that are too light of green during the summer (the water washes out all the nutrients), and that adds to the stress when they are brought inside.
If you just bought it, go ahead and leave it in for now, and then put it out next spring, after danger of frost.  We half bury the pot ouside (so the wind doesn't blow it over) in an area where the sprinklers hit it.  With it outside, it can be pollinated by bees too.  If it's inside all the time, you'll have to hand pollinate it.
"
1897,"Usually when you buy plants from the store, the soil type might not be suitable to them. Is it safe to change the soil completely? I mean to remove all the soil around most of the roots, then put it into a pot with new soil. I can think of 2 disadvantages: 

The roots cannot hold on to new soil
The roots wouldn't have adapted to new environment.

Would it help if I only changed the soil away from the roots? Are there certain plants more tolerant to such changes and others that aren't?


If the soils types are completely different, even though washing out all the soil may damage the roots, sometimes that is necessary.  We have soil that is almost sand, and if the plants are left in the original rich mulch and planted in that soil, the sand sucks all the moisture out of the mulch and leaves the plant stuck in a hard, dry medium.  If the mulch isn't washed off the roots, many plants can't survive.
So while usually it's much better to leave the plants in the soil they came from, in a few cases that is not the best option.
When we do change out the soil, we dig a big hole, and keep the plants in water and mud while rinsing.  There is a LOT of water used in the process, so the roots are gently rinsed and never get dry.

1901,"Can kitchen wastes (like potato peels, onion skins, orange rinds, egg shells, tea inside tea bags etc) be used as manure? If so, how to use them? 
Right now, I'm just dumping them in soil, which I feel is a wrong way to do this. Apart from looking like garbage, it takes a long time to degrade. I wonder whether they degrade at all, or just get buried in mud while watering. 
Will it cause any damage to the plants? Is dumping them on soil considered okay? Or should they be treated in some way before dumping them on soil? 


You should compost them before dumping them in soil. The food waste is not degraded and bacteria/bugs in soil will try to degraded some while releasing bad smell. Also it doesn't look good and require a long time to degrade too. I should warn you, there will be plenty of bugs if you just dump the food to the soil.
Learn how to compost, you can search up this site about composting. I believe there are plenty of question about composting.

1902,"Something has been eating my tomatoes just as they begin to ripen. Each day I've been finding one or more tomatoes half-eaten but still attached to the vine. On a couple of days I've also found bits of tomato skin scattered around a wooden chair a few feet away from the tomato plants.  
I haven't seen the critter(s) in the act. I'm guessing it's a squirrel, as we have lots of them in the neighborhood, but it could be some other small mammal.
I've grown tomatoes in the Sacramento region for years and this is the first time I've had this problem. Does anyone have any ideas on whether it's likely to be a squirrel or some other animal? More importantly, is there anything I can do to keep the critters away?
Update: I've selected a ""best"" answer, but please feel free to add your suggestions if you have a better idea. I'd love to find a way to deter the tomato-eating critters without going to the trouble of enclosing my tomato garden in a net.


One option to consider, and I am trying this next year because we had the same issue as you, is I am moving the tomato plants to an upside down hanger.  I have a metal hook hanger that should keep the tomato plants off the ground and out of reach.  Since its smooth metal it should keep the critters from climbing, but if not I have a blocker I can attach to the pole to keep them from climbing.

You can use kitchen wastes in a similar way to what you're doing. It's called trench composting:

Dig a hole about a foot deep.
Add your kitchen scraps.
Bury with the soil from the hole.

They will break down over time.
Now with that said, there are ways you can improve the process. Kitchen scraps are typically mostly nitrogen, and if you can balance it out with some carbon (leaves, straw, wood chips, sawdust, dried out garden wastes, etc) then the composting process will proceed more quickly.
The major risk with any process like this is if you have animals around that will try to get into the kitchen scraps. (And this is true for any composting process that isn't fully enclosed; I've had skunks dig up scraps from under 2-3' of horse manure.)

1913,"I live in an apartment building, and my landlord has neglected to mow the back yard for quite a while now. In this time period this unknown plant that I've never seen before has grown to a height of about 38iches (965mm).
I live in Central Missouri, this is the first year I've seen this plant, either here or anywhere else in Missouri. In the first photo you should see the central part of the plant, which is the tallest, and it looks like it has a good root system going because the other leaves look like they're coming from the same system, but I'm not 100% sure because I don't know a lot about plants.
Photos: (Click to enlarge)




It looks like some kind of corn (maize). This was my first thought - a grass related to corn, but I wasn't sure so I've just checked with MrsWinwaed (ecology professor) and she says ""definitely a grass, probably a seed corn""?
Comparing to the corn I have grown in the past, it looks like you only have one flower type? (my corn had male and female flowers) and the flower heads appear with small plants.
Do you have a bird feeder near by? It could be seed from that which has grown.
Edit: Addenda: MrsWinwaed adds that may also be a type of sorghum (ie. another monocot/grass). Bird seed would still be the most likely source. Note that the seed could be from last year, or it could have been carried in.
As for removal, you are probably limited to physical removal. Even a very selective weedkiller is going to kill all grasses/monocots - not much good in a lawn, unless you can live with yellow spots of grass around each treatment.

1921,"So I've got a large front yard and I want to use a hedge to divide it and provide some privacy. I live in Western Australia so the soil is very sandy and the area receives full sun, sometimes getting to 40 °C (104 °F) in summer. Also I'm looking for something that will grow like a weed.
What are some plant types that will make a good hedge and survive in the harsh Australian sun?


I'm in Newcastle, Australia, and have a very happy Murraya growing in my front yard.  It receives full sun in a Northernly aspect.  
It grows like mad in summer and requires trimming once a week.  Top temperatures here are usually 30-35C, but 40C is possible.  It is fertilized with cow manure.  I rarely need to water it but the topsoil here is not sandy.

1922,"There is a Kadota (I think) fig tree in our yard - the fruit is massive, slightly squishy, and the holes at the bottom of the figs are starting to open and they're starting to pale.
How do I tell if they are ripe or not?  They're only drooping around a centimeter and are growing bigger daily.


I've got a green fig tree too (as of 9 months or so) and was unsure how to pick a ripe one too, but I've had plenty of practice now. Just wait until they give slightly under pressure from a gentle squeeze, similar in texture to brown figs but usually without any signs of browning.
In my case the green figs were ripe at the same size range as with brown figs.
If you do see one that's got some hint of brown it's probably overripe and may be starting to rot on the tree.
After picking the first one and testing the sweetness, you may prefer to let them hang until they're a bit more ""squishy to the touch"", but that's up to your taste.

1929,"The bugs are exceptionally small. I've included a video here.
It may be related to the stretched and disfigured appearance of my tomatoes.



Best guess based on the video is that you have some sort of aphid. Is it soft bodied? A close-up, in-focus photo of the insect would be helpful.
If they are aphids, you can knock them off with a spray of water, or spray with a dilute solution of soap (about 1 tablespoon of dish soap to a gallon of water).

1937,"I went to pick up some liquid fertilizer for the plant I keep at work and I saw several varieties :

Liquid Growth Indoor Plant 4-12-9 Food;
All Purpose Liquid Concentrate Plant Food 12-4-8 with micronutrients;
All Purpose Liquid Houseplant Food 8-7-6.

Do the numbers have any significance? If so, what do they mean?


The three numbers should represent N-P-K:

N for Nitrogen - helps produce more chlorophyll – makes the leaves/lawn look greener
P for Phosphorus - promotes root development
K for Potassium - helps with winterizing, and drought resistance.

1947,"My lawn is infested with dandelions. Although they're benign, the flowers are fun to play with and the plant has several useful properties, it sure is an eyesore and I'd like to get rid of it. How can I eradicate this weed without damaging my lawn?

Source: Wikimedia commons


@Mancuniensis has a good answer. I would add that dandelions can be controlled by de-heading all flowers and flower buds before they go to seed. This goes a long way to reducing their numbers in future years.
I also find they are very responsive to the broad leaf weedkillers and the weed&feed treatments. Ie. not much is required, and stronger ""kill everything"" weedkillers are not required. These days I use the de-heading combined with limited spot treatment with a broad leaf weedkiller once or twice a year.

1954,"So, it's nearly cleanup time in Wisconsin and I finally got around to refinishing my tools. I bought a can of boiled linseed oil and coated the tools with it (helps prevent rust).  
Now, everything is covered in boiled linseed oil.  What on earth am I supposed to do with these tools now that they're all goopey? Do I just have to leave them hanging till I want to use them again?  Would I need to recoat them if I go and use them?  And do some tools need multiple coats of oil? 


You should wipe the tools with a clean cloth to remove excess oil. The excess oil will accumulate dust and other particles that you don't want to leave on your tools. When I want it to soak into the handles, I let it soak for an hour or so and then I wipe away all excess oil from all surfaces.
If you have covered the tools well, you should be able to wipe them clean and then store them for months without worry. You aren't trying to scrub them totally clean, you are just wiping away the excess.  As long as you coated them well, they should last 3-6 months. If you are storing them in a really humid location, or have any other environmental conditions that might make it more extreme for the tools, you can re-apply more regularly.

1961,"I have a lovely jade plant (Crassula Ovata) growing in the bathroom, but it keeps outgrowing pots and needing to be repotted. I have tried moving it further from the sun and watering it less to try and slow its growth, as I read somewhere that works, but it doesn't take too well to that.
Is it just something I need to live with, or are there ways to slow the growth of succulents?


Prune it hard.  Crassula Ovata can make a very attractive bonsai.  If you keep cutting back the leaves it will put growth into the roots and stem.  If you search for crassula ovata bonsai on google image search you will seem stunning bonsais with massive trunks like this http://www.flickr.com/photos/anafont/3409308362/.
One bit advice though - move it to somewhere drier than a bathroom (assuming you have it in a bathroom with a shower) for a while after pruning because the cuts need to callus over in dry conditions to avoid the risk of rot or fungal infections. 
I water mine thoroughly once a week during the summer and lightly once a month in the winter and try and give them as much sun as possible.  
Be careful moving from low light to lots of light - do it gradually or you can burn the leaves (they shrivel and turn black)

Are there ways to attract birds into our garden naturally (e.g. certain plants/landscaping), and at the same time, also provide a source of food for them?


Provide somewhere for them to nest.  So far nesting boxes have not worked for me but a dense evergreen tree or two would provide a good habitat.
I would also look at discouraging cats.

1971,"I planted raspberry canes last autumn which have grown well and produced a good crop this year. Some of the canes have grown to 7 or 8 feet and are dangling over the fence into a neighbour's garden.
Can these be safely cut back at this time of year?  (early autumn, UK)


I live in Manchester, your neck of the woods, and have summer-bearing raspberry canes. I usually prune out the fruited canes to ground level in late summer/ early autumn, and the new canes always produce a good crop the following year; in fact, autumn pruning is recommended by the Royal Horticultural Society - see How do I maintain a Raspberry plant? Pruning out those long fruited canes now is not likely to cause the plants any harm at all.

1976,"We have a large garden (<2 acres) that we are growing for the Post Falls, ID. food bank.  The farmer is supplying the water.  We have 5 zones across the garden and move the sprinklers three times to water the entire area.  We are continually watering each zone for 12 hours, and then moving the sprinklers to the next section, water it for 12 hours, moving it to the next section and water it for 12 hours.  We do not stop watering during the entire growing season.    
It seems that the garden is not ripening as fast as gardens in the city. Can a garden's average temperature get lowered due to the watering, possibly delaying the harvest time?


Watering could cool temperatures - because the water is cool, and (more importantly) through evaporation.
However, I think it is more likely you are simply watering too much, making the soil too wet. How often do other places water? Here in Texas (hotter and drier in summer), 30 mins or 60 mins watering in the evening is more common, and I typically water much less (balancing water conservation into the mix).
I would look into what other food growers in the area do, and try that.
Over-watering can also cause mineral / nutrient leaching.
You're probably already doing this, but are you making and applying compost? just checking - that could make a huge difference if you are not doing this.

1987,"I have some tomato plants indoors. Recently a number of very small (1 mm or so) moths dwell on the leaves.
What are these? Are they harmful? What can I do about them?


Chances are very good this insect is commonly called whitefly. As a tomato plant is considered an annual and we are are getting close to end of season where I live you could ignore the problem as they do not damage the fruit.  
If you are keeping the plant indoors then you should act quickly or the whitefly can spread to a wide variety of plants.
Check the link for recommendations:
What has worked for me is: 

hose off the underside of the leafs first to physically remove the
adults   
place yellow sticky strips close by to attract newly hatched 
a dilute solution of soap and water applied every few days for seven to
ten days should catch all new issues.  The hairy leaves of tomato

I think the recommendation is to wait until it is dry. As well as clogging problems, you can damage the grass - although this latter issue isn't a problem for a heterogeneous low quality ""lawn"" such as mine!
Raising the blades will reduce the amount of cuttings produced - so this will reduce clogging.
Also, have you considered leaving it on the lawn as mulch, rather than bagging? This should help but it will still have some clogging problems - the grass can build up between the blades and cover to eventually stall the motor.

1995,"I bought this plant from a home repair store 3 days back, but I don't know what it is. Now it seems that its decaying. What is this plant and what do I need to do to take care of it?



It is a begonia, probably a Rieger begonia. Check this begonia care site for details.
Begonias commonly get gray mold (Botrytis). Since this fungus moves from dead tissue into living, pick off any dead flowers or leaves as soon as you can. Try to keep the foliage and flowers dry.

2001,"I am experimenting this autumn with more autumn/winter vegetables than I am used to. I have cabbages and leeks near maturity which will be the main events, but I've also put in some August sown purple sprouting broccoli. Not sure if it'll work, but I'm hoping for a crop early next year.
At this stage (September) the seedlings are still quite small.
At this time of year, high winds can be a problem. Do broccoli (and similar) plants, which are hardy enough to survive winter, need protection from winds? If so, what's the best approach? 
I'm figuring it's too early to put them under glass or polythene, there can still be a lot of heat in the sun during the day.


I currently have unprotected broccoli, and we just came through two major wind events: first was a thunderstorm (~50-60mph) and second was Tropical Storm Irene (~30-40 mph). One of my seedlings (about a foot tall at the time) was flattened by the thunderstorm and another by Irene. Both bounced back and seem to have made a full recovery, about 2-3 weeks later.
In the past, I've used row cover supported by 1"" PVC ""tent frames"" to protect spring broccoli. I shove the PVC into the ground a couple of inches to secure it, drape the row cover over the top, and weight down the edges with rocks. It's dual purpose: keeps off the cabbage worms and protects it from wind. (It also provides a couple degrees of frost protection, but that doesn't seem like an issue in your case.)

2032,"We harvested all of the remaining carrots in our garden, and to our surprise a large number of them are white or bright yellow in the center, rather than being orange all the way through. The white carrots taste fine (very sweet and crunchy), but they don't look like any other carrots that I've seen before... more like a carrot that swallowed a parsnip. What causes this? Is it a problem?


It's perfectly normal. All carrots have a core, sometimes they are different color than the outside of the carrot. (I planted red carrots with an orange core last year.) The size of the core depends on the carrot variety (e.g. Nantes coreless has -- surprise -- a minimal core). Varieties with wide shoulders will have a bigger core. You can also end up with a bigger, tougher core if they remain in the ground for too long.
If the appearance of the white core bothers you, try planting one of the ""coreless"" varieties next year, and be sure to harvest before they get overmature.

If you're watering in the evening, try switching to early morning (much easier with a programmable sprinkler system).  Watering in the evening can leave your soil too moist for too long, which encourages fungus growth.  With morning watering, the daytime heat will help to evaporate some of the moisture, and discourage toadstools and various other fungi that can actually harm your lawn.  HTH.

I get this question all the time at the garden center that I work at. There is nothing to be concerned about with mushrooms growing in your lawn. The only reason they are there is to decompose some form of organic matter. When they have done their job, they will go away.
Trying to get rid of them usually proves futile. They always come back. As long as they are not poisonous, you should be ok. Even if they are poisonous, you have very little to worry about unless you or a pet eats them.

2048,"This is probably a simple question but I just want to know any common advice for collecting seeds from mustard greens.
4-5 self-seeded mustards (Brassica juncea) popped up in the autumn and I just let them go to be green manure, but I've neglected to hoe them back into the soil so far. Now the seed pods are getting quite large and so I may as well collect those before turning the plants into green manure. Any advice on how I can collect as much mustard seed as possible from them?

Do I remove the stalks (that contain the pods) from the plant now (they're not yet brown)?
I assume I'm then supposed to hang up the stalks some place safe where they won't be disturbed until completely dried.
Do I need to put bags or containers under the stalks in case the seeds start dropping out by themselves?



I have never collected mustard seed, but I can tell you my standard approach to seed collecting. Wait until that pods just start opening or are turning brown. Then cut the stalks off and dump them head first in a paper bag. Label the bag. Let the seed heads dry out in the bag for a few weeks. Collect the seed from the bags, and put them in a sealed dry container in the frig. Label the container.

2053,"I found an interesting lesion on an oak leaf in my back yard (Upstate South Carolina). What is it? I am asking about the marble like structure since I am fairly certain that the larva (shown at link) belong to an acorn weevil. 




It looks like a oak apple gall, a leaf gall commonly caused by the larva of a wasp (Amphibolips confluent and others). The larva lives inside, both causing the gall and feeding off it. Eventually, it tunnels its way out. When the gall matures, it turns reddish (apple-like) and then brown.
According to Insects That Feed on Tree and Shrubs by Warren Johnson and Howard Lyon (1988), many other insects in addition to the gall maker, the wasp, feed on the gall. Apparently, it is tasty. So who knows what you may have found inside. They also mention that the oak apple gall ""does no measurable harm to its oak host.""

2055,"I recently bought a house, and would like to keep my lawn looking as nice as everyone else's in my neighborhood. Right now I water every zone 5-8 minutes, every other day.

The heat alone shouldn't be enough to kill your lawn; my bet is that your soil is too compacted and can't retain the moisture.  If you dig into your soil 9-12 inches, you should notice it's much cooler, and therefore, less susceptible to evaporation.  I agree with the recommendations for aerating the lawn; however, you should also change your watering schedule.  
Your watering schedule should probably be twice a week, and a long cycle (30 minutes or more) on the sunny parts.  You want to encourage the roots of the plant to grow deeper to look for water.  Watering light every other day will encourage a shallow root system, which will exacerbate the yellowing problem.

The problem that I see is that instead of worrying how many minutes your sprinkler is on you should be worrying about how much water you are getting. What you are doing now is stressing your lawn in the sunny area. Infrequent thorough watering will make your lawn stronger and make it grow a longer root system to withstand lack of water. Put out rain gauges throughout your lawn and see how long it takes to reach a half inch. That is how long to set your timer. Water your lawn like this twice a week in the early morning. I am basing this on experience and recommendations by many Florida agencies.

2062,"I laid out a soaker hose system for my garden this year. Unfortunately a few weeks ago I went to turn it on and noticed a loud spraying sound coming from one area, when I removed some mulch the water shot approximately 10 feet up in the air.
It shouldn't be too hard to find the hole, but what is the best way to fix it? Its a soaker hose, so the repair does not need to be water tight, but it should be enough that it maintains the pressure in the rest of the hose and will stay put so the hole doesn't reopen or get larger.


I recommend paying a visit to your local hardware shop, large DIY store... and pick up a ""hose repair kit"" (or a ""splice connector"" might also work for your needs), it should cost no more than a few $'s and will enable you to fix the hose properly.
Another alternative, if the hole isn't that large, repair the hose with a bicycle tire repair kit...

The situation:
The only space I have for a garden is on my balcony.

The plants that I am going to suggest are those that will require limited sunlight, but sufficient enough to promote vegetative growth. Since these all will be in pots I suggest getting pots the largest size possible for best results. For instance in a large 5 gallon or bigger container you could plant a number of herbs that would do well in the situation. Spinach, lettuce and any number of greens could do well as long as the weather is warm enough. Once that you have given those that are likely to grow a chance to start, then you could start experimenting with veggies such as tomatoes. Good luck.

Yews should do the job as they can be trimmed easily and sprout new growth on old wood.  They are slow growing unless you pamper them with water and fertilizer the first few years. 
Even easier, and thinner, is a wood/aluminium/steel fence with vines growing on it. You can get privacy, flower and fruit with less than three feet of width.  Some vines that would work are roses, clematis, wisteria.

2076,"I have some garden soil that has decaying spruce needles mixed through it. What should I do to the soil in order to grow vegetables in it normally?


Suspect over-acidity... check the pH and add lime if needed.  Is the soil good otherwise?  Spruces (at least around here in New Hampshire) are often in pretty sterile soil that needs amending with other, sweeter organic material, like composted manure or other compost.
When there's too much uncomposted ""brown stuff"" (leaves, etc.) in the soil, it will rob nitrogen in order to digest all the carbon.  So consider adding nitrogen one way or another.
If the dog has also been urinating in the area a lot, it can mess up the soil.  Apply gypsum for that.
Does the soil drain well?  Is there hard pan underneath it?

2081,"Does it matter where on the stalk you cut or remove the fruit off the plant so that you don't suck away its future earning potential?
Let's take the photo here, of a Cayenne pepper (Capsicum annuum), where the chilli is now ripe and ready to burn up the dinner plate.

Usually from the store, this type of chilli comes with some of the stem at the end of the red.
In order to make sure the plant keeps on keeping on, can you just pluck out the red part and leave the nub? Or do you have to cut it off the plant somewhere along the lines where the sun doth shine?


You'll find that in most plants, it is very easy to pluck the fruit by removing the stalk from the node (marked in blue) on the stem. If you do remove it from there, the wound is very minimal and the plant heals very quickly. 

Now it might not be that much of a problem (in terms of being prone to diseases) if you snip them off mid-stalk with scissors/pruners. However, the plant will slow down the fruit production until the rest of the stalk has dried fully and fallen off the stem. So in a sense, you're aiding the plant by removing it at the node on the first go.
This is the same advice given for flowering plants: dead-head the flowers to encourage new flowers. Fruits are merely pregnant flowers. So more flowers -> more fruits.

@yoda's answer makes sense, but to be honest I just pull them off - usually they break at the node as that is the weak point. If they come off at the 'cap' then I do remove the rest of the stem - but that is the only time.
I haven't noticed any problems or reducing fruit. You do want to remove the peppers when ripe (or when they are ripe enough for you - most green peppers are technically not ripe!), so that the plant produces more fruit. Keeping ripe fruit on the plant discourages new fruit forming.

Also your local agricultural university (not sure if that will be U.Oregon, or if you have an ""A&M"" as it were) will usually have very extensive local crop guides. As well as viability, cropping, harvest times, they will also cover common regional issues such as pests.
Note: I don't know Oregon that well having only visited for about 1hr, but there is probably more of an east-west variation in climate than north-south. You have the coast, the Cascades (altitude) and then probably a rain shadow.
Finally, that harvesting range is just that - plant earlier, and that is when you would typically harvest.

The links in the other answers are great starting points, but experience will be your best teacher. The best advice I've read is to keep a gardening notebook. At a minimum, write down when you plant, the problems you encounter, and when you harvest. (You can also write down how much you harvest, which is helpful for figuring out how much you should plant next year.)
When planning the season, look back at past notes to figure out (a) how much to plant, (b) when to plant, (c) when to expect to harvest, (d) how to prevent problems that you've encountered in the past.
In this answer to a related question, I listed a strategy for figuring out your own planting schedule. Using this and your notebook, you'll be able to figure out a schedule perfectly customized to your own backyard.

What is the criteria for picking out the three sisters and how does one help the other? 


An additional aspect of the Three Sisters combination not mentioned in the other answer is that eating the combination of beans, corn, and squash provides a complete protein and a good balance of nutrients. I'm not certain, but I think your combination of sunflowers, peas, and squash might also provide this balance.
You could combine something tall like okra with a ""bushy"" cover like cabbage and a vining climber like peas. This would give you the cultural requirements: peas provide nitrogen to the okra, okra provides a support for the peas, and cabbage helps to choke out weeds. But while you'd get a decent shot of vitamins from eating the combination, you may not end up with a complete protein.

Beans will be tough if you let them go too long. Pick them while they're small and you'll get more tender pods. If the actual bean (the inside part) is starting to bulge, you've let them go too long.

Bstpierre's answer is a good one. I would just add that if you pick the pods several times a week to prevent any from maturing, not only will they be tender, but the plants will continue to crop for six or seven weeks. When harvesting, you can make sure you don't loosen the plants, either by holding the stems as you pull away the pods, or by using a pair of scissors.

I brought the leaves inside, washed them, and set them on the counter in the kitchen while gathering other ingredients for pesto (grating cheese, etc). Many of the leaves started to turn black -- especially at the tips and in the veins. It didn't seem to affect the quality of the end product.
I'm planning to dry the next harvest batch, and I'd like to make sure it doesn't turn black during drying.

What makes basil leaves turn black?
What should I do post-harvest to prevent this?



I have had that happen when I put the basil into a sink of water to wash instead of washing the cuttings under running water. The newest growth turned black and even older growth did at the ""crotches"". 
I maintain indoor plants for a living, this is exactly the same reaction as over-watering does to a plant. My understanding in that event is that it is caused by root rot. In the case of my basil, I think the high growth areas soaked up so much water from the sink and had no way to drain it again, as there is an incomplete circulation system once cut.  The effect was the same as bruising, or early rot. 
 I hesitated to use them in pesto, but they dried just fine. 
No recurrence since I have stopped washing them in a sink of water, just running water.

Related to this, would ""cool climate"" plants have a resistance to occasional night-time frosts?
I ask because I'm wondering what chance cool climate vegetables would have in my backyard garden, where it can be consistently frosty starting anywhere from the end of November until mid-January. 


Cool climate plants are plants that grow best during the cool, damp time of year starting near the last frost in spring, and sometimes in the wet period of fall.  The plants that grow best during this time are naturally tolerant to some frost. Read the seed packet instructions for the information needed to properly grow these plants.

2141,"I have a kind of perennial evergreen grass that I would like to spread around the yard. How can I save seeds from the plants efficiently ?


It's probably easier to buy it than get the seeds from the grass. To harvest the grass seed you need to stop mowing it and let it ""go to seed"", or let seeds form when the grass gets tall. After they've dried out and turned brown (depending on the grass), you can shake the tops of the grass stalks and the seeds will fall off.

2142,"I've got a cedar tree that divided into two smaller trees, and the previous owners tried to keep the twin trunks together by tying a rope around them.  The rope eventually strangled one of the trunks, and now it's dead; at least, all the needles are brown and it doesn't look good.
So, I think the thing to do is to cut down the dead trunk, but this will leave half the tree bare.  The question is, will the remaining trunk eventually grow branches in the newly cleared space, or will it just keep growing up and out on the side where it already has branches, and never fill in the open space?


You should definitely cut down the dead trunk. the stump should be cut as close to live wood as possible. If the rope is still on the tree it should be removed. The trunk itself will not sprout new branches, but the growing tips of the branches will grow into the area and eventually cover it. That could take some time though. If you thin out the branches and remove the broken, dead, and crossing branches, the tree will grow a little faster and look nicer while it heals. It might take a while, but it will be worth it.

2151,"My house is surrounded by rocks (wraps all the way around the house and in places is 10 feet wide) that my father-in-law put in 20+ years ago, way before my wife and I bought his house.

There is black plastic underneath the rocks, but I'd imagine that either, much of it is damaged, or enough organic material decomposed on top of the rocks to give everything a nice layer of sediment in which to grow weeds (and there are lots of bushes that were ripped out without ever repairing the plastic.

Alternatively you might try throwing buckwheat seeds into the dirt areas between the rocks. The buckwheat grows quickly and is easy to pull out. This might loosen up the soil between the rocks a bit. I had some success with this when removing deep sediments from cracked concrete. This might be a good idea if you want to keep the dirt to turn it into a planned rock garden, instead of removing the dirt from the rocks completely.

I'd estimate a few inches of mulch in the area at question.


I think you should, because the mulch is going to let water pass right through it.  It will be better if you remove the mulch, regrade the soil so that you have at least a 1/4"" per foot drop moving away from the house and pack the soil to encourage the water to deflect away from the house.  Then the mulch can go back on top and water passing through will be slowed down by the mulch (preventing erosion) and run off the soil away from the house.

I don't know where you are located but if the climate and seasons are slightly different from its native habitat (originally Balkans-Himalayas) then it may lose it's leaves slightly earlier or later than in its native habitat.

2176,"I'm growing an avocado plant from the pit (started with the toothpicks and glass method). Unfortunately I was out of town when it hit its growth spurt and therefore was not there to pinch back the first set of leaves when it was 6 to 12 inches tall.
All of a sudden it's close to 3ft tall and I'm not sure what to do. I intend the plant to stay potted, so shorter and bushier would be preferred. Is it too late to pinch (or clip) back my avocado plant?



I have grown avocado from seed a number of times and found that it will respond to being cut back.  Even the severe pruning you will have to give it will cause a new tip to start. 
The avocado is a tree and exhibits apical dominance.  Cutting it back will not necessarily cause it to branch out.
Other environmental factors such as the amount of sunlight, size of the root ball and timing your pruning are just as important.
For your plant, if you can provide direct sun for 8 to 12 hours a day and a consistent watering regime I would cut it back.  In lower light conditions you will be waiting a long time for a new bud to start.

2188,"This MyTinyPlot.co.uk blog post photo showing some enviably healthy looking autumn lettuces under protection got me down the garden centre today looking at protection options for my autumn/winter veg.

You can see they're using some kind of super fine fleece.
But what is the difference between plain old clear polythene (AKA polyethylene) / mesh / fleece? For cold weather protection. When do you opt for one or the other? 


The tradeoff is: the heavier the fleece (and thus more protection), the less light you'll be allowing through. Depending on your latitude, day length can become an issue in late autumn -- you'll want those plants to get as much light as possible. Though, if you're mostly focused on harvesting during cold weather and your lettuces are already mature enough so that growth isn't as much an issue, you don't need to worry as much about this.
If you're willing to do extra work, heavy black plastic provides good protection in my experience, and can usually be acquired cheaper than specialty gardening fabrics. The catch is that you have to remove it every morning so the plants can (a) get light and (b) don't cook.
But I generally take the super-lazy route: switch from eating lettuce to eating hardier plants: spinach, chard, kale, and beet greens. These don't need protection.

The best solution is perhaps to choose both row covers and plastic.
Kingbird Farm, a small herb grower in New York state, describes its efforts to winter some USDA zone 7 and zone 6 herbs (rosemary and sage) in zone 5. They found covering rows of crops with row covers inside a small plastic hoop house to be the most effective.
(They used Agribon AG-19 row covers made of spun bonded polypropylene fabric.)
"
2191,"I have just planted some grass seed to replace some grass lost after the dry summer. I have been watering it daily for 3-4 days. How long should I keep this up?


The reason you want to water so frequently is to keep the soil and seeds moist during and immediately after germination. If the seeds dry out while germinating, they will die.
When we've planted lawn in the past, we water at least daily -- sometimes twice if it is really hot and sunny, or windy (which also dries up the soil). If it is cool and overcast you can water once daily. If it rains, you don't need to water. You don't need to water heavily, basically so that it stays moist and the soil and seeds don't dry out. (You can check the soil in the area -- if it is moist, you don't need to water.)
Once most of the seed has germinated (i.e. the grass is growing), you can gradually decrease the frequency and increase the amount. Watering deeply will encourage the plants to send roots down deeper into the soil which will allow them to better survive dry periods. You just need to give them a chance to develop these roots initially.

2192,"I have an English walnut sapling that grows vigorously all summer, but at the beginning of Fall the leaves dry up and fall. It has been two years now. Is that a problem with the tree?


According to a couple of different sources, walnut trees are among the first to lose their leaves. (And among the last to leaf out in spring.) Those pages are discussing Juglans nigra (Black walnut), but as far as I can tell Juglans regia (English walnut) behaves the same way.
There is a fungus, walnut anthracnose, that can cause early leaf drop. You didn't mention symptoms of this, and you'd have seen leaves drop back in August. Also, English walnut is less susceptible.
So what you are seeing is normal unless you have the spots on the leaves and fruit as seen in the photos in the link above.

Slugs are great workers in a compost pile. 
Leave a hearty amount of vegetable left-overs (eg: potato and orange peels) outside during the night and come back early in the morning. It'll be full of snails that you can either get rid of, or throw into the compost bin. 
You can then proceed to add a wall of egg shells to make sure they stay in the compost bin.

Q. Can I expect it to give fruits in a non-tropical, moderate climate such as the one found in Northern Portugal? (It should, as apparently we gave the avocado to the world :P )
Q. And if so, is there any special care I should have for the tree to thrive?


Well if it is a native plant to your area & climate, you shouldn't have any major problems.
Here in Texas they're only considered a marginal crop down on the Mexican border. We're in the North Texas area (further south than you, but more continental) and our frosts kill them every winter. A shame: As you've found they're easier to germinate than many of the online guides suggest - it would something different to grow.

Here's an idea that makes a lot of short term work but has paid off for me in the long run.
Add a water feature with some shallow  (1"" to 2"" deep) areas.  You will attract birds, frogs and toads who will assist in keeping the slug population low.  This does not eliminate all slugs, just some of them.
And, it takes time for the word to get out that your garden is a good place to live.

2238,"I have been growing a few varieties of chili pepper (incl. Scotch Bonnets) in my garden since April (Spring). Due to trees, other houses, etc., they only get about 6 hours of direct sunlight a day.
Is this amount of sunlight sufficient? Is there anything I can do to help them?


My Habaneros do remarkably less well than other Chili kinds in little sun, moderately cold environments. I've found Lemon Drop, Bell Pepper, and especially Rocotto types to be much more resilient. Some Rocotto types are as hot as Habaneros too.
If you plant in a garden, as opposed to pots like I do, you can try to mulch and/or bury some dead wood around your plants to keep soil temperature high, and plant wide apart so they at least don't have to fight among themselves for sun. On the other hand, I can bring my potted chilis indoors for the final harvest before winter.

I don't want to seem to be against the ""do-it-yourself"" crowd, but at 60' tall the only safe answer is to hire an arborist.
Consider paying a professional to do the job of cutting off the second trunk versus the alternatives:  

possible personal injury while climbing the tree  
possible damage to your property, or someone else's property, from what falls from the tree  
not getting a clean cut and possibly adding an avenue of insect or fungal attack.

2262,"When is the best time to start germinating my chili seeds (various varieties) in order to make the most of next years growing season?
I think I started too late this year and my crop has suffered. I live in London,UK and the last frost according to this website is in late april. When can I sensibly start growing the chilies indoors?


Probably ""whenever you want"" as long as you have the light and your location does not get too cold.
Also if you are growing them a long time inside, you will want to plant the seedlings into pots so they have room to grow whilst they're inside.
I'm lucky here in Texas in that our last frosts are in March so I can get away with sowing them outside, but sometimes I'll start them a few weeks earlier inside and then plant them directly outside. Allow two weeks for germinating, and with another 2-3 weeks they'll be ready for taking out of seed trays and putting into pots. Keep them in the pots until May.
I soak the seeds in a salt petre (potassium nitrate) solution before sowing - this is meant to help with the harder to germinate varieties, but I have not done any side-by-side tests.

2295,"I'm sure I saw a site on the Internet that showcased using excavated tree roots as a landscaping feature. I was inspired by the idea of ""recycling"" a tree stump and its rootball
into a rockery garden by dumping a lot of soil onto it which forms pockets of soil between the roots where plants are able to grow. But I can't find anything about this method.
Did I dream about this or does anyone know what I am talking about? 
I'm having a tree root extracted from my driveway and would like to try this idea, but would like to research more about how to best go about it.       


Sure you can do this.  But...dead wood that is damp and in contact with the ground is also the perfect home for carpenter ants.  Should you do this just make sure the wood is far, far away from your house.
If you still like the idea:

cedar is more resistant to rot than other types of wood  
to get an aesthetic ""natural"" look up to two thirds of the stump should be buried depending on how much of the stump comes out, or you can bury it upside down.  Most trees have their roots within a foot of the surface so you will get a nice web of roots suitable for pocket planting.  
from an ecological point of view a dead tree is worth more to the forest than a live one. Good for you for considering providing a home to, potentially, thousands of organisms.

2314,"If all goes according to plan, I will be moving this winter to another location.  I currently have two blueberry bushes I planted last spring, purchased from Gurney's.  I'm wondering what the procedure might be to transplant a plant like this given that it was only planted a few months ago.  Is it better to leave the young plants and get new ones next season?
My only concern is whether the plant has a good chance of surviving the transplanting.  I've considered moving them into pots now before the freezes come in southeastern PA.  Is that recommended with it so close to frost?


I'm not an expert on the topic, but if it were me, I'd just leave them be and plant new ones next spring in your new location.
My reasoning:

You're going to shock them and set them back when potting them.
You're going to shock them again and set them back when planting in your new location.
There's a chance they won't survive either the potting or transplanting.
There's a chance the potted plants won't survive the move.
Moving large potted plants sucks. [I hate moving.]
For ~$15 each, you can buy new plants. With all of the setbacks your current plants will already have, a new plant may catch up to your potted transplants within the first year. For my time, it would be worthwhile to avoid the digging, potting, and transport.

Your mileage may vary...

This lily is odd because of its hosta-like evergreen leaves. It is tolerant of shallow planting, weekly mowing, poor soils, and dense shade. The flower is like an Easter lily. What is the variety name?


Given that it grows on poor soils, is shallowly planted, is evergreen (since it stays green this time of year), and has a white easter lily like bloom. I would guess it is Madonna Lily (Lilium candidum) (USDA zone 4-5).

2370,"When patching a section of an existing lawn, should the turf be laid

Lay it on top of the prepared soil, and around the edges move some of the soil out in order to leave it flush with the adjacent ground. This will work in most situations. If you live in an extremely dry area you would want to leave it slightly below the surrounding ground.

2381,"I have a trail about 10' wide going down a hill in the woods behind my house. This particular section has a ~10-15% grade. It receives regular foot, tractor, and log skidding (i.e. behind the tractor) traffic, so there's not much that grows in the pathway (and planting some kind of turf grass won't work). The soil is gravelly under the duff layer. The area receives minimal light since this is going through the woods. The edge of the trail is a mix of brush, saplings, and large trees -- more the latter than the former.
When we get heavy rain, parts of the trail wash out. It can be repaired, but I prefer prevention over cure.
What are my options for preventing erosion on this trail?


Suggestion gleaned from here.
You might try some water bars. This is a small trench at an angle (30-40 degrees) to the trail at intervals filled with rocks or a log. These will catch water and shunt it to the sides of the trail so that it will not flow down your path. They also suggest digging drainage ditches along the sides of the trail to catch the water.
Id suggest (partly because they are effective and partly because they are really pretty) forsythia planted along the sides of the ditches to prevent erosion of the sides of the ditches.
Something like mulch or landscape fabric might also be worth considering, but so far it looks like water bars may be your best bet.

Place clear plastic water bottles in your garden, half fill them with water so it can be seen there is water inside. Cats and dogs mostly will not poop there as it by instinct not to.
Also, you can try putting sticks in your gardens, poking up! If there is no clear place to rest you bottom, then you will find another place where you can.

2396,"I've been told to follow up an infestation of apple scab by composting any leaf litter on the orchard floor to destroy spores. I plan to haul away most of the leaves to my garden composter but a 5% urea solution is indicated for the orchard floor. How much should I need per mature tree (10 ft diameter drip line) and are there any safety concerns with preparing the solution in a sprayer tank?
I figure 5% urea solution is about 2 lbs (pounds) urea in 5 gallons. It comes from my coop in 50 lb bags of prills. 


According to UMass, you should spray 100 gallons per acre, or .00229568 gallons per square foot. A 10' diameter circle is 78.5 square feet, thus requiring .18 gallons. If you make one gallon of solution, you can treat 5 mature trees.
If you have the trees planted in rows in an orchard, the orchard will cover more space than just adding up the trees. (E.g. 10 trees in two rows of five with a uniform 10' spacing will use more than 785 square feet of space.) This is because of the gaps between the circles -- and you'll want to treat those gaps as well.
A 50 lb bag of urea will make about 125 gallons of solution, or enough to treat 1.25 acres of orchard.
Note that the article linked above suggests the use of feed grade urea as it dissolves better.
I'm not qualified to comment on the safety aspect.

2467,"I have standard roses.  As the weather warms, and after feeding with commerically purchased rotted chicken manure they are growing very, very fast.
Is there a way I can get them to produce more flowers rather than growing long stems like the one that goes out of frame in the top right of the picture below?
If I trim the longer stems off to bring it back to shape will that stop it flowering?
The roses pictured has been there longer than I've owned this house - so I guess it is at least eight years old.  I pruned the head of all the roses at the end of winter down to a few sticks.



Chicken manure has a high level of nitrogen, Which encourages stem and leaf formation. If you are more interested in the flowers, add more potassium and less nitrogen. Wait until the temperature stays mostly below 45°F (7°C) and then prune it back, and thin the bush. It will naturally grow some long canes and that is fine, as long as it is properly pruned and fertilized and it gets a good amount of direct sunlight. Severe pruning will result in rapid growth and less flowers. It will try to regrow. Give it a lighter pruning to promote flowers.

Any and all suggestions appreciated!


With an area that large, you'd have a huge amount of work to dig out all the roots by hand.  I'd think about using power tools to do it.  
However, your landscaper would probably use power tools to regrade your yard, so what I would do is cut off all the branches and cut the trunks back to a few inches above the ground.  When you're getting quotes for the job, ask them to include the cost of digging up the root balls as a separate line item.  It might turn out cheaper than renting a digger yourself.

I suspect most weed and feed products will be pre-emergents, meaning you need to get it in your lawn before the weed seeds have a chance to germinate, which is a limited window.  Once something like this is already growing, you're usually left with the round-up type of products, which kill everything they touch, or hand pulling.
After a long day in the office, sitting outside on a nice day, pulling weeds, can be therapeutic.  Just make sure you get as many of the roots as possible.  And with viney or runner spreading weeds, try to get the entire runner.

Also searching for this info on the Internet is hard since 'giant'  is also a brand of sunflower seeds (apparently not coming from giant sunflowers)
Should there be anything inside the seed pods to begin with? i.e., whether or not certain sunflower varieties are purely ornamental.


Do you mean the flower has died back (all brown and dead looking), but when you break the head apart, there aren't any seeds? These are typically black or stripey.
If they are missing, then the florets did not pollinate - I've often seen this where only a part of the flower pollinates, and perhaps the edges don't. Also, don't discount animals. Birds and squirrels will be quick to feed on a sunflower head. A squirrel will usually destroy the whole thing, but birds can be more adept at picking the seeds out.
The last time I grew sunflowers, they were ""Mammoth"". 8ft high perhaps, although this varied (some as low as 4ft), single flower per plant. The stems were notable woody. A wooden tube with what resembled foam on the inside. The foam rots quickly leaving a wooden tube. I sawed mine up and threw them in the compost.

Rule of thumb: prune heavily in winter/spring before growth starts.
If you prune lightly in late summer/autumn, only remove green (not wooden) parts.

Edit: 
The tree hasn't produced in 2 years, I live in west Michigan and the last few years have been rather odd in that we get 1 week of summer (80-90 degrees) followed by a week or so of spring again (40-60 degrees)  I have noticed flowering generally at the top of the tree during the 1 week, which don't come to anything over the ""real"" summer.  The rest of the tree is bare, no leaves, no flowering nothing.
I don't know how long the tree has been there, it may have been planted when the house was built (1994) which would make it an old tree but I'm not sure about that.  It is about as tall as the house (1.5 story above ground) I don't know if that is ""big"".


Peaches bear fruit on last year's growth. So pruning is essential. 
Worse, no leaves = no food for new growth. The erratic spring in the past two years might prevent pollination, but not leaves.
You could try  pruning up to 1/3 of the tree in April. You can take out dead wood immediately.   Unless you see some sprouts next year, it's dead. On the plus side, when you cut it down you can find out for certain how old it is. 
Like other stone fruits, an open vase pattern of pruning and training is commmonly used.  But you can also prune a peach to a central leader (Christmas Tree) system.
I'd look for a University Extension bulletin about growing peaches in your area. For a start, check out Michigan Peach.org. Some pictures of the open vase pruning guide can be seen in this Guide to growing stone fruits in Wisconsin.

2583,"My Adam's needle yucca flowered for the first time this year. It does not look like it is going to grow in that area anymore, but the leaves are still green. Should I cut it back at all?


You need only prune out the spent flower stalks. Aside from removing old leaves and flower stalks, yuccas do not require any pruning. If you need to prune to control height, prune in the spring before new growth begins. If the plant is well established, you can cut it off at any height (including ground level), and it will begin two to four new stems from right below your cut.

2584,"I read a random article about the effects of a certain fertilizer on tomatoes and how it happened to increase the protein content of the tomatoes relative to other fertilizers (1, 2) and it piqued my interest.  I've also read that wheat grown at certain parts of the year have more protein content as well.
Aside from choosing to grow lentils or some other high-protein plant, what are the methods of increasing the protein content of your garden edibles?  If they vary by plant family group, then what are the methods that work for different family groups?


Aside from some sort of hormone type application, I would think you just need to make sure they have enough Nitrogen.  It is the Nitrogen that forms Amino Acids, which then build protein.

It does not spread, it doesn't turn brown during winter or during droughts, and it is exceptionally shade tolerant. What kind of grass is it?

That looks like fescue to me.  Fescue does not spread (with the exception of some rhizomous varieties) and is very shade tolerant.  It's down side is that it will need a lot of water in hot/dry climates if it is not in the shade.

2593,"An aloe plant I have on my table now has leaves with yellowish ends and I'd like to somehow address it. I Googled for a while and found that in case of aloe this may be a sign of either underwatering or overwatering.
The plant is about 120 millimeters tall with diameter about 250 millimeters, the pot is about 120 millimeters tall with diameter about 100 millimeters filled with ground almost to the edges. I water it once a week pouring about maybe 20-40 milliliters of water.
How do I know if I water aloe right? How do I know if I'm underwatering or overwatering it?


Water only when it's dry.  But don't wait beyond then.  
How dry is dry?  The soil should be dry to the touch.  Depending on the soil, it will usually be a lighter color than when it's moist.  If you poke into the soil, say 5-10 mm, you won't find moist or darker soil just underneath the surface.
Water thoroughly.  If the pot doesn't have drainage, err on the side of too little.
I suspect you're watering too little, too frequently.  Watering just a little at frequent intervals creates a deficient, shallow root system.  The bottom of the pot never gets wet, so roots don't go there.

Aloes are drought tolerant (a much larger one did very well in our Texas summers outside without much water) but 20-40ml does sound very low. Does the pot have drainage holes and free-draining soil? If so, I'd give it more, but don't water log the soil. If it doesn't, then consider changing the pot and the soil - it will make it easier to water correctly and suit the plant a bit better.
Also, is it pot-bound? It seems like it might be a small pot for the plant?

Until now I just found two sources:

Plants making oxygen
How to Grow Your Own Fresh Air - TED 2009



I have a great deal of skepticism about the idea that less than an acre of plants in full sun can make a substantial difference in the oxygen levels of an enclosed area.  Most tropical plants that are inside are receiving from 100 to 500 lux. 
Outside in the northern hemisphere on a cloudy day is around 50,000 lux.
How can you reduce the amount of light by a factor of 100 and get the same amount of photosynthesis going on? I see a commonly quoted figure of ""Plant leaves produce 5 milliliters of oxygen, per leaf, each day."" but I don't see under what conditions this is measured under.
I don't think you can produce enough oxygen inside a room unless the roof is glass and you fill it entirely with any type of plant.

From comment: It happens indoors more often than out. I do not think it is my cat. He is not allowed in the house.
From here: The soil is good, dark, crumbly garden soil that grows plants very well.

If the Aloe Vera in your question has the same potting medium as quoted above, I believe over watering or the high moisture retention properties of the ""potting medium"" is the most likely cause of the tips curling up.

2631,"I am trying to grow mint. I did repot the plant cutting away excess roots. I placed the plant where it gets direct sunshine for about half a day and water the plant occasionally. It does pretty well with leaves showing up in a few weeks.
The questions I have is about ""harvesting"" the mint leaves. I read about cutting the flowers when the plan starts flowering, but I have no idea what the flowers look like(especially new ones). Also when I cut the leaves off a branch, the branch seems to dry up and die in a few weeks. So I would like to know about which leaves to cut, where (leave a little leave stem, all of the stem, etc.), distribution(all on one stem, location), leaf size, etc.
In the picture below, the plant has plenty of leaves, but the stem on the right seems to be dying because I took all the leaves from that stem?
 


If you had more mint, I'd go with what Yoda said.
But for a plant you're harvesting as hard as shown, pulling the biggest leaves will result in a lot of bare stems and a pretty lanky plant - as shown.  So I'd suggest going the opposite way.  Harvest from your tallest stem, starting at the top, and pruning back as you harvest.  When you get down to around 2-3"" from the bottom, repeat with another stem.  
My sense is that you'll have a lot more attractive, healthier, more productive plant that isn't wasting a lot of effort pushing nutrients up long, leafless, nearly woody stems.

2641,"Recently I needed a pot with a shape that would make it as stable as possible so that it's unlikely to tip over and fall from the shelve. I was looking for a pot as close to a cylinder as possible.
I had to search many shops before I could find a suitable pot, almost all pots are wider at the top than at the bottom, they are usually of truncated cone or rounded at the bottom form.
I'd like to know why the cylinder shape is so rare. Does having a less stable form than most pots have give any advantages?


The simple answer is to minimize the size in transit. Conical shapes slide into each other producing a neat, stable stack. Cylindrical shapes can’t slide into each other, which effectively quadruples the size of the pot.
That and as Ed Staub said, it makes plant removal a bugger.

2647,"I'm wondering if it would be too late in the season to overseed, repair a cool-season lawn in preparation for the coming Spring.
I live in Atlantic Canada.
I've been fighting with our lawn since we purchased our place. The majority of it is weeds, I have no experience with this and am really at a loss of where to start without just starting from scratch.
Edit: Adding photos.







Starting in spring might be a better idea if you are looking for a quick result. If you reseed in the fall many of the seeds will remain dormant until spring, letting weeds sprout. If you wait until it warms up in spring, the seeds will quickly sprout and fill in.

2653,"I had a potted aloe plant that looked like a set of leaves coming out of a single spot at ground level. One day it just fell apart - the leaves and the roots got completely rotten at ground level and wouldn't hold leaves together and to the ground. Leaves otherwise look alive - they are just damaged at the end where they were connected to the root.
According to this answer aloe plant leaves can be planted on their own and can perhaps start growing as separate plants. Will that technique likely work in my rotten case? Do I have any other options?


If your leaves have rotted at the base, there is nothing practical you can do to save the plant. The leaves, though you can sometimes root them, would probably do poorly because they are not fresh. The best thing to do would be to find out what caused the rot, buy a new plant, and carefully monitor it so that you can fight the rot as soon as it appears.

Bonus points for ""interesting to look at"". Cacti seem low maintenance and resilient, yes? What other choices are there that I might consider?


We've had a Christmas Cactus (A.K.A. Holiday Cactus) in our bathroom window for over ten years now, with very little watering. I have a picture of the same young plant (in bloom) from the 90's.

The name of the plant comes from the bright flowers that bloom during Christmas. It's remarkably unlike traditional cacti and from a distance it doesn't look like one.

2667,"Today I was part of a volunteer team that cut back just over 800 square metres (roughly 8600 sq. ft.) of sea buckthorn encroaching onto a nature reserve, which basically came down to lopping and sawing, while avoiding getting covered in thorn scratches and berry juice, followed by burning.
Once that is complete, the roots need to be dug up. And it grows back at an astonishing rate.
My question is - are there any more effective ways to remove it?


I can't see how there can be any options other than strong weedkillers or physical removal, and obviously blanket use of weedkillers is out of the question in this case.
What we did in a similar situation in Texas with Ligustrum (brushy/woody invasive but no berries and no spines as such; known as 'privet' in the UK) is to cut it down to ground level, and then brush a kill-everything bush weedkiller (eg. Bush-B-Gone) directly on the fresh stumps. That is sufficient to kill the roots, and the application is localized to the stump only.

2673,"I have read that composting things like bones and fat should be avoided as it can get smelly and attract pests.  However, I expect that there are a lot of nutrients that I am wasting if I threw these things in the garbage (or the city compost).
So, I am planning on building up a new compost pile this fall and letting it run till next fall.  I have a ~2' diameter, ~3' tall compost bin.  I am planning on lining it with composted manure and bone meal to deter pests.  I will supplement the heavy kitchen waste with plenty of branches and leaves.  Will this work?  What else should I be doing (esp. about the pest deterence)?


Fat and rotting meat are better suited to creating manure. Bones don't compost easily either. The fastest way to break down fat and rotten food is to have an animal digest it first. I take my leftover bacon lard and dribble 1-2 tbsp per day on my dog's food... he loves it! Depending how rotten the meat is, I may or may not give it to my dog as well (he doesn't like chicken). However cooked bones should merely be discarded since they take a long time to break down. Only raw bones are good for dogs--small bones like chicken bones are not good for dogs either.

2680,"I've got a big, lovely rhubarb plant in my yard which I'd hoped to be able to harvest a few different times over the course of a summer. How should I harvest my rhubarb to encourage it to regrow quickly? Should I cut it off near the base, pull it up from the root, or something else? Should I harvest it all at once, or should I leave some of the stalks in place?


I watched a video on this precise question because my neighbour invited me to take rhubarb from her plant, and I wanted to make sure I did it in a way that wouldn't affect her plant.
The video was made by Tom Cole at Capel Manor College in London. It has been deleted, but these are the points I took from it:

Don't cut the stalk with a knife. Pull it right out with a sharp tug. This apparently promotes new growth and ""invigorates the roots"" so it helps the plant. (Also the bit right at the bottom is the most delicious part to eat!)
Don't take more than 3 or 4 stems per season per plant. I actually took up to 5, because there were so many, but I think the idea is to make sure to leave the plant with at least 3-4 stalks leftover for the new season.

2681,"I have an old woody sage plant (I think it's sage) in my herb garden. It's probably several years old and no longer looks in great shape. Also, I have allowed the grass and weeds to smother its base.

If I pruned it back and weeded it, would it come back good as new? Or is it best to start again?


You can cut it back in stages, removing a third of the plant each year for three years. It takes time, but the results are normally satisfactory. Cut the old woody stems to 3 or 4 inches from the ground and cut out the dead stems each time you cut back. It would help the plant to keep other plants from growing around the base.

2686,"Australia has a problem in that most garden and building centers where you can buy seed usually only sell one or two brands and there is such limited variety e.g. beans, lettuce, tomato etc. Also, the country being isolated, there are several restrictions on what can be imported, etc.
For my own interest I would like to try growing a larger variety of vegetables.  How can I go about finding alternatives to commercially available seeds or maybe heirloom varieties to try? I'm not looking for a specific retailer, but rather for the most logical place to look for alternatives.


Take a look at Seed Savers Exchange. I don't know if they have any ""branches"" in Australia, but you may be able to find related/similar organizations where you can find a larger variety of seeds.
In the same line of thought, ask the vendors at a local farmers' market. (You'll probably have better luck if you aren't asking during the busy hour.) Look especially for growers who are selling ""unique"" or heirloom varieties. They may be able to point you to good sources for seed.

Yes, most olive trees are frost resistant, but do not like it to get too low. Usually the most cold-tolerant varieties can take temperatures of down to 15-20 degrees Fahrenheit. If it gets colder than that in your area, or stays cold for extended periods, try moving it indoors to a sunny window during the worst parts. But once it's used to indoor temperatures, it can be damaged more easily by sudden placement in a cold environment. Try not to water too much during cold periods because the plant slows down and can't handle as much; too much water can cause root rot.
On the flies, I'm not entirely sure what they are, without a picture, but if you put a layer of dry material (such as pencil shavings or shredded paper) on top, it will discourage the laying of eggs.

I guess it's probably due to a rotten root.
A large pot would hold more water than a small pot. Watering once a day is perhaps too much for a large pot. I have two basil plants in large pots and I water them once every 3 days. Of course the duration depends on how fast the water evapourates. You can test the soil for dampness using your finger before you water.
You may want to keep them in smaller pots and indoors. Add a little water every night so that they won't dry out. When they are 10cm above the soil, you can move them outdoors, following proper transplanting techniques and you should adjust your watering accordingly.

It depends. It may not make sense for you to try (too much work, or too many plants needed for good seed).
A hybrid is a cross of two different lines, and may well not breed true.
For a discussion on the broader issues of saving seed, have a look at  Gardening When It Counts, the author talks about saving seed, he ran his own seed company for a number of years, so he does have a good bit of experience. He talks about how many plants you need, hybrids, etc. It is a complex subject, it may be that you cannot, or that you can for just one generation (plant the bought seeds, collect seeds from them, use those until the are gone over the next few years).

My mother in law liked to put eggshells (not crushed much) at the bottom of pots when repotting. Served the dual purpose of drainage (as some people might use gravel) and possibly providing calcium. With the added bonus that eggshells are easier to come by than gravel for many people.
At the top of the pot I doubt it would do anything much. I'm not really convinced it did much at the bottom. I put my eggshells in my compost so the vegetable garden gets more calcium.

In addition to acidity (probably not a problem), and very slow calcium release, I'm going to offer a hypothesis as to why she does it...
Crushed eggshells are sometimes used as organic methods of deterring certain pests, especially gastropods such as snails and slugs (see this question). Gastropods are unlikely to be a problem in indoor pots, but perhaps she saw someone do this outside around plants in a bed, and copied it? Or even an ancestor did this, and it has been passed down through the generations from village gardening in beds to modern city gardening in pots?
Similarly, it might have been done to help with calcium deficiency in beds, although digging the shells in and crushing them would be much more effective.

If I keep the moss in a closed jar then how do I avoid molding?

Keep the lid off, or add spring tails (molding eating bug), or let the mold run its course.

Do I need to put soil in the jar?

No, moss will grow on anything really. It likes acidic soil, though I use peat moss myself and it works well.

What do to in winter?

It doesn't matter. Moss in the wild freezes in winter and when the rainy season comes again it'll spring back. It'll do fine at room temperature; just keep it moist and out of direct sun and should do fine.

Can the spores be contained if grown in a closed glass container?

I'm unsure about this, but I have two 10 gallon tanks with moss and a 40 gallon tank with just moss in it (used to house plants and frogs) and I'm fine, so I dont believe they cause any problems.

Heavy ammunition.  Chooks (chickens) like slaters, if you're interested in raising them.  Otherwise, consider iron-chelate-based slug pellets.  
Prevention.  I've had the same kind of weird problems when we've had earwigs in the garden in the past.  The underlying cause, I believe, was mulching or top-dressing with compost that was too woody, providing good living quarters and a resulting population explosion.  When that happened, they started eating foliage, which they don't normally do.  
I suspect you've done something similar - a lot of rotting woody material on top of the soil providing a good home for these guys.
Even if you use non-woody mulch, keep it away from seeds and seedlings.

That is a dumb cane (Dieffenbachia). While these are generally grown outside in the tropics, they can be grown indoors as they don't mind the shade. Wikipedia also lists some ideal growing conditions:

The plant needs light but filtered sunlight through a window is usually sufficient. When the plant is brought home from the nursery, it will likely need repotting. The plant needs moderately moist soil. The soil should be fertilized with either regular liquid fertilizing or fertilizer pellets or spiky spikes. Leaves will periodically roll up and fall off to make way for new leaves. Yellowing of the leaves is generally a sign of problematic conditions, such as a nutrient deficiency in the soil.

One good use for oak leaves is as an overwintering blanket for tender plants.  Unlike maple leaves which tend to lie flat and create an impermeable sheet, oak leaves curl. With enough of them and a tomato cage, you can make a nice blanket which will protect your plant from the desiccation of winter winds

Yes, I should think so, but I suppose the success rate would vary depending on what kind of bulb it is. Bulbs contain the food or nutrients to keep it alive while it is dormant through the winter. Sixty days in the fridge is shorter than an outdoor overwintering and definitely cool enough so they should be fine.
If the bulb is too squishy it might have started to rot, or if it's crispy it might have died. Otherwise I think they have a very good chance of germination.

Yes they are, and I've seen my wife (biology professor) demonstrate this at a city event in front of TV! There are a few folk recipes that use acorns, but yes they are very bitter due to the tannins they contain.
Quericus (oaks) are a large genus of trees. I would not like to rely on ALL of them being edible. Seek out a local expert on your local oak species first...
My wife adds: she thinks all of them technically are, but whites are more palatable than red or black acorns due to the tannins. White oaks have smooth lobed leaves, red oaks have points on their margins.

2939,"Our lucky bamboo has turned yellow in a very short time, after we've had it for almost 2 years. We've trimmed all yellow leaves, and changed the pebble to clean the green algae - what else can be done? Why did this happen and what can we do to save it?






I've seen symptoms like this when the water has dropped too low (roots start to die and rot) and/or when the water has turned anoxic (no oxygen). Note that rotting roots when re-submerged will quickly turn the water anoxic.
I consider my answer and yoda's above to have a lot of overlap. We're both talking about a root problem and some variation of suffocation/anoxia.
One symptom of chemical anoxia is a sulfurous smell - and I have smelt this with lucky bamboo in an extreme case (stems had truly rotted!)

2947,"""Willow water"" is a term for water that has had willow soaked in it to extract compounds that improve the chances of a cutting growing roots. Here's a fairly descriptive article on it.
I tried it once when I was given some cuttings from a ficus tree, and one cutting grew roots (it's now about a metre tall, and makes a nice indoor plant).
What I don't know is how much of a difference it really makes to use willow water rather than just plain water (or commercial rooting hormone). Does anyone have a good feel as to how much it improves the strike rate of cuttings?


Willow water could contain an unusually high amount of ""phyto-hormones"", which support the growth of roots. I think this will be an auxine-derivate, which the willow contains. Clear water doesn't contain those phyto-hormones. So plant and root-growth comes from the cuttings themselves. However, I'm not 100% sure. 
Conventional rooting hormones containing those pyhto-hormones, but they are synthetic. One exception may exist, if I'm not wrong — There's a product based on a special variety of seaweed. The seaweed used contains a relatively high amount of auxines and this product might be used in organic horticulture/agriculture in Europe.
"
2948,"This list of jobs for November suggests sowing peas and broad beans. The comments section is more specific about varieties to go for, namely: Aquadulce for Broadbeans and Douce Provence for Peas.
How important is it to use the suggested varieties? Would using any old beans/peas result in nothing at all, or just produce slightly inferior results (or something in between)?
Should I expect germination and a small plant over winter, or do the seeds just sit there in the ground only for something to appear in Feb/Mar?
The comments also suggest they go straight into the ground, but presumably starting off in pots will also work?


It is important to use the given varieties or similar ones for over-wintering.
These varieties are bred for this purpose, while others may not be and might die when the frost hits.
Old vs. new seed: You can test if the seed still grows. Use kitchen paper, fold it like an accordion (/\/\/\), wet it, put the seed on it and wait. If seed is thick or hard (like beans), you could put everything into a jar with some holes in the cover. If the seed is very old, you will have only inferior germination or none at all.
After seeding, I would expect a small plant over winter which starts to grow in spring. But I'm not sure on this point.
Seeding into pots should also work. You could try both now and next winter, you'll know what the better way is.

2963,"I currently live in a condo with a limited sized balcony.  Which vegetables work out best for a small garden?


I have almost no land but I am still able to grow a plethora of fruits, herbs, and veggies. If you have the pots and soil, you can grow whatever your local area can provide based upon weather and sunlight. 
I grow: tomatoes, strawberries, peppers, key limes, lemons, beans, lettuce, radish, catnip, onions, basil, spinach, pineapples, and much more herbs. The small trees I have are in large garbage cans, and everything else is in pots with potatoes in the ground. 
Good luck! Just keep working on it and check to see what will grow well in your area.

2969,"Do wattles (roughly Australian Acacia species) have the same ability as other members of the Fabaceae (legume) family to fix nitrogen from air via symbiosis with soil bacteria? For instance, it's well known that peas and beans do, but what about the more tree-like legumes?
It's not a completely academic question for me. I'm wondering if planting wattles would be a useful way to gradually improve the surrounding soil by adding nitrogen, while being a chance to plant native species.

(Acacia buxifolia image source)


My understanding is that this is one of the defining points of the Fabaceae. Trees in this group definitely act like legumes - other examples include mesquite and Texas red bud. As it happens, only a couple of weeks ago I was talking about plant diversity with MrsWinwaed - one of the ones I mentioned were the Fabaceae which include clover, beans, and mesquite - three quite different looking plants!
Another feature of them is they usually have high protein levels (eg. beans) due to the extra nitrogen made available by the nodules. Acacia are known for having high protein, so I think it is safe to say they do fix nitrogen in reasonable quantities.

But, nearly every winter we get significant snowfall that ends up sticking around for months.  By the time it melts, much of the lawn has been torn up with vole runways, which do grow back eventually but often leave the lawn significantly lumpier.
Is there any way I can prevent the voles from running around under the snow cover undetected, eating my lawn?


In addition to chemical and mesh repellant techniques, you could have a look at things like these noise repellors which appear to work. They use a noise that is inaudible to humans but apparently really annoys moles.

If you want all of the plants to be the same type, you would probably want a row of shrubs that grow between 3 and 6 feet tall and don't spread much. Blueberries would do well in your location, if you have an acid soil high in humus.  Thornless blackberries would produce lots of fruit, but take a lot of care in pruning and supporting. Grapes need more attention than blackberries, but are more versatile in what things they will grow on, and what size they will get. 
If I were in your situation, I would plant four blueberry bushes spaced evenly over the length of the plot, and plant Seascape strawberry plants around them as a groundcover. Although strawberries aren't normally planted around blueberries, they easily adapt to it and it looks attractive. This would also work with the planting of flowers through the garden, if the strawberries are spaced far enough apart.

I'd think blueberries, too - except for the driveway location.  You neighbor may not thank you for all the blue bird-poop.  If you are willing to put netting over them, if you need to, then I agree that they're the best fit otherwise.
You might consider golden raspberries.  The canes are nowhere near as nice to look at as blueberry bushes, but the berries seem to be invisible to birds.  And they're delicious!
I wouldn't call raspberries invasive, but you will eventually need to prune them to keep them on your side.  And of course, they have thorns.  This can be good or bad, depending on the situation.

How to manipulate a cactus that has thick long strong spines without harming hands?


There are a few different options here. 
One of the easiest and readily available options is to use a towel. Wrap the cactus in the towel and gently grab it (I'd still wear good thick, possibly leather or other pierce resistant, gloves) Don't press too hard or the spines will still penetrate the towel, but this gives you a good gripping option hopefully without damaging your hands.
If the spines are very sparse than you might be able to find a hold without any help by finding a hand hold between spines, however I'd still get a good pair of gloves just in case.

I use long handled pruning shears and a wheelbarrow.  I use the shears to cut off pieces and then pick them up and put them in the wheelbarrow, grabbing more gently with the shears.  Since they are replanted by placing them on bare dirt and ignoring them, I just use the pruning shears again to gently remove them from the wheelbarrow.  And of course, I still use heavy leather sacrificial gloves, as others have mentioned.

If you are worried about it, put a 6' diameter circle of topsoil mixed with compost around the tree to a depth of about three inches.  I do not recommend replanting as this will set back the tree. My method will actually speed up the maturity. It works especially well if you maintain a 1"" mulch of organic matter around the tree. One of my trees has the graft about 6"" above ground and it is fine without any protection.

Sweet potato slips root readily in room temperature water near a light source. The slips are 8"" cuttings from the growing tips, with all of the completely mature leaves removed. Tomatoes are also easy to root this way. Change the water and rinse the roots in room temperature water every other day for best results. Peppers take longer, but they will root. Fig trees root pretty well from ripe-wood and hardwood cuttings.

3044,"As I was planting a few fruit trees last weekend, I discovered an odd and very annoying phenomenon. About 6"" down from ground level, I ran across a 2"" layer of really crumbly concrete/gravel mixture. Beneath that was clay for as far as I dug. The dirt above the concrete layer was slightly better quality topsoil.
I found this in every one of the holes I dug for the trees, which spanned a length over 60' about 10' away from my privacy fence. (The trees were dwarf fruit trees, hence the closer spacing. The recommended separation between trees was 15'.)
At first I thought I discovered some sort of massive French drain covering the entire backyard. But when I looked closer, I realized it wasn't just gravel - it was actually crumbly concrete. Does anyone have any idea why this was in my backyard? And will it significantly affect the trees I just planted?


Who knows? There could be lots of reasons. It might have been to help drainage (although proper rounded gravel probably does this better), but it might be just builder's fill - and a bulldozer leveled it out before the final top soil was added.
A large number (majority?) of urban backyards in the US are made of varying degrees of builder's fill. All they are doing is leveling it out with whatever is lying around, what was dug out, demolished, etc. Older houses tend to fare better (but have the most 'history' from previous owners instead) - newer houses tend to be worse.

3047,"I have a large aloe plant that is probably 5 years old and has bloomed twice.

Very robust at the top however heavy and leaning over cannot support itself.
Q. How do I save this plant?


Rotting in aloes is caused by fungus. The fungus enters through weak or dead growth, and spreads and grows when any of the following factors are present:

Very high humidity
Low light
Too much water
Poor drainage 
Extended low temperatures
Extensive cuts or bruises
Sitting water at the base of the leaves
Sunburn (usually only in potted plants moved from low to full sun)
Too much fertilizer

Prevention is better than cure. Try to provide the best conditions you can (ie, the opposite of the factors listed above). To control, apply a fungicide according to the directions on the label, until the infection is gone. Reapply at any sign of recurrence.
I had some problems with rot in my potted aloes, until I repotted them into a lighter mix.

Probably from the builders, as winwaed and LarsTech already point out, and previous structures that were built there.
Though our backyard sounds much smaller than yours, it sounds like you've been just as unlucky. Our house is on land near a city centre that has undergone an ""urban renewal"" project, transforming from really shabby houses to slightly larger houses on slightly smaller blocks.
Our backyard's soil was so bad, and so crammed full of the builder's fill that winwaed describes, that we decided to get the top 15cm (6"") soil removed and replaced with a sandy loam/compost mix. During the process we not only found crumbly concrete from previous house foundations, but many well-rusted copper pipes from what must have once been a bathroom and bits of tile and crockery.

The average yearly rainfall for this area is forty inches. Is there a better producer that will grow under these conditions?  


I have grown sunflowers for seed for several seasons now in central Iowa.  That should be pretty close to your climate with a bit less rain and slightly more extreme temperatures. (We typically see -15F in winter and 95F summer and 35in total precipitation).
I plant enough to harvest a half dozen to a dozen flowers (2-3qt yield dried with hulls).  So this is totally unscientific anecdotal data :).  The best performing variety for me has been Azteca.  Azteca is a Medium height (6'-7') single flower variety.  6'-7' is short enough that I can harvest easily and the flowers are very large.  The multiflower varieties that I have tried have had much smaller flowers which is more effort to harvest and seem to produce less seed.  I have tried mammoth grey stripe but with them I had over 1/2 my plants blown over in a summer thunderstorm.

Barberry could work, but is considered invasive in some areas. Dwarf Burning bush would work also.

Wait until the foliage yellows, then remove the plants from the pots, trim off all the tops and roots. Plant them 4-6"" deep if you have a sandy soil, slightly more shallow if you have clay. Cover the soil with 1"" of a straw-type  mulch and tamp down. It should then need no further attention until spring.

I would like to know, just because I'm curious  and would like to experiment, is it possible to graft any cactus as a scion to a non cactus succulent rootstock?


Succulents, in general, are plants that have adapted to living in dry/arid/desert-like conditions. Cacti are a subset of succulents and are entirely native to North and South America and as such evolved very differently from other succulents in Africa/Asia. For one, they have spines whereas most others do not, and presumably, there are other physiological differences.
One of the most important factors in successful grafting is that the vascular systems of the rootstock and the scion be a close match. I don't know very much in detail about the biology of succulents/cacti, but given their isolated existence and independent evolutions, I highly doubt that you can graft any cactus onto any non-cactus succulent.

However, when it doesn't rain for periods of a few weeks in a row, should I then be going back to watering, at least for non drought-tolerant plants? Or are the plants in semi-hibernation, making watering in the winter unnecessary?


Our climate is different, but I would let the soil tell me - if it's dry below the top half-inch or so, I'd water thoroughly.  Don't just sprinkle - it encourages shallow root growth, when you want them deep instead.  
I'd expect water needs to be reduced in the winter, but not gone.  It will vary greatly from plant to plant.

3074,"Is it bad to water plants after the sun has gone down or near dusk?  If so, why?


It is only better to water in the evening or early morning from a conservation perspective due to evaporation of this precious resource.
Otherwise, the idea it's bad to be watered under the bright midday sun because it hurts the plants themselves appears to be a myth. See this article by a well qualified horticulturist debunk it.

There are many causes of leaf scorch, but irrigation with fresh water is certainly not one of them. Hundreds of scientific publications on crop plants, turf, woody shrubs and trees have examined foliar scorch, and not one of them has implicated midday irrigation as a causal agent. What does cause damage, however, is suboptimal plant-water relations, which can result in tip and marginal leaf scorch, shoot dieback, stunted growth, and leaf abscission.

3079,"I lifted some carrots this evening. It being December these are carrots which have been in the ground some time. They're big and fat, they need cleaning up and the damage needs cutting out, but basically most of them is OK to eat.
As I clean them up I see that there are holes and tunnels, the usual with root veg which has been a bit neglected. OK, slugs, I'm thinking. That's fairly normal. 
But as I work on them a bit more I find woodlice in the holes. Are woodlice a root vegetable pest, will they eat carrots, and have they made those holes? If so, is there any way to control them and keep them out of my veg?
Or are they just sheltering in holes made by other creatures?


Woodlice eat dead vegetable matter, but they normally do not attack live plants. They are probably just in the holes because they offer protection from the weather. If the holes are large and appear at the top of the root, the culprit is probably slugs. If the burrows are smaller and run along the root near the skin, you probably have had carrot rust fly maggots sometime during the growing season. Applying pesticides will keep these away, but, when grown in a good, active, organic soil and given enough water, the plants will take care of themselves.

I can't separate the soil from the seedling ( without using a toothpick/needle ) and I can't just watch them die.
How do you water in such case? I think that the water will be too much if I use a spray.


Tray watering is the standard way of watering plants so that the soil surface is not damaged. The water is poured in at the bottom - so no damage, and then soaks up through the soil. The seedlings will need to be in a shallow tray for this to work (it won't work with a deep pot unless the plants have a good root structure). For my pepper seedlings, use the standard seed trays, and leave one of the squares ""empty"" so I can pour water into it - the water goes straight down into the tray without damaging the peat or washing seeds around.
If light surface watering is required, try a spray instead? This will then soak the upper soil surface without washing it around.
The perlite is probably floating due to surface tension effects - is it drying out? Keeping the perlite damp would avoid this (although it might mean the soil gets too wet and lead to damping off / etc of the seedlings).

@winwaed's answer is definitely the right way to do it for conventionally grown seedlings.
But you can sidestep this entire issue (how to best water tender seedlings) by using soil blocks. These are a compressed soil mixture that holds a surprising amount of water. I like to start small seeds in 3/4"" blocks, larger seeds in 2"" blocks. (When the seedlings in the small blocks get big they can be ""transplanted"" into a larger block.)
I put the blocks in a tray with low sides and when they need watering I pour a small amount of water into the tray. The blocks absorb moisture from the bottom.
The last time I planted I think I counted 300 of the small blocks and 50 of the larger blocks on a standard sized cookie sheet.
(This assumes that whatever you are starting will germinate and grow properly in the media required to get blocks to form well.)

3087,"I have a lot of leaves on my lawn (in Oklahoma). Will it hurt the grass if I leave the leaves there over the winter? 


Yes, if they get matted down - just like covering the grass with anything else would - by reducing sunlight and air circulation.  
Less importantly, leaves will compete with the grass for nitrogen - they consume it in decaying.
Oak leaves are especially bad because they're acidic.
Some folks have good results with shredding leaves and leaving them on.  Not me.  I suspect this may work well (or at least better) if you fertilize a lot, which I don't.
Grass still grows in the winter, except when it's very cold - just a lot slower.

Pigmentation from the soil can also pose a problem. Soil colour and suspension will be the problem with the solutions. A well designed solution such as Universal Indicator might be accurate enough where you need it but it will be difficult to read with soil discoloration. (universal indicator is great for schools as it is easy to use and covers a wide range, unlike litmus paper).
The lab readers are going to be overkill - so cheap digital or analog will be your options. For our Costa Rica work we use a cheap analog reader from a garden center - primarily because it will easily go through aircraft security and customs and cheap if it breaks (also it is more likely to break...)

3104,"I'm not an expert on plants, but would like to add some plant life to my apartment. I'm looking for good choices that:

don't require direct sunlight
require minimal watering
survive for at least a few months at a time
have low risk of attracting pests

Bonus points for ""interesting to look at"". Cacti seem low maintenance and resilient, yes? What other choices are there that I might consider?


Dieffenbachia species tend to make good house plants. They don't need much water or sunlight and tend to be really hardy indoors. A brand name of one of our Dieffenbachia is ""indoorstructable""!

3114,"I want to be a good composter, but turning my pile is backbreaking work.  
I was looking through a gardening magazine today and I saw a contraption that was basically a three foot long pole that had 6"" arms that fold in along the side when pushing in, and then expanding out when you pulled it out.  The idea is that you just plunge it in and pull it out a bunch of times and blammo - aeration.

From Double Winged Compost Aerator
Do these types of things actually work, or do I just need to stop being lazy if I want to aerate my pile?


Your pile will compost without turning it, but it goes faster if you turn it.  A pitchfork and a little bit of work every few weeks or months will do just fine

3118,"I have a vegetable garden that bugs just love. Since my family is going to eat these vegetables (and I'd prefer that the bugs do not), what organic pesticide is most effective? The main culprits are aphids and cabbage loopers (or inch worms) though any pesticide that targets critters that eat leafy vegetables would be helpful.


I use neem seed oil effectively. From the wikipedia article (emphasis not in original):

Formulations made of neem oil also find wide usage as a bio-pesticide for organic farming, as it repels a wide variety of pests including the mealy bug, beet armyworm, aphids, the cabbage worm, thrips, whiteflies, mites, fungus gnats, beetles, moth larvae, mushroom flies, leafminers, caterpillars, locust, nematodes and the Japanese beetle. Neem oil is not known to be harmful to mammals, birds, earthworms or some beneficial insects such as butterflies, honeybees and ladybugs if it is not concentrated directly into their area of habitat or on their food source.

She tried a BAYER spray for mite control but they are coming back every time she has the rose plant inside the house.


Either soap and water applied at 5 to 6 days intervals with particular attention being paid to get good coverage on the underside of the leaves or keeping the rose outside would solve this problem.  This answer is very detailed; I recommend looking at it.

3123,"This harvest I was not able to pick a single corn cob.  Some large animal(s), I suspect raccoons, got to them before they were ripe (I would find peeled and gnawed corn littering the lawn and the corn stems bent down when I got home).  I had crushed garlic all over the garden.  This kept the rabbits away, but was not effective against the large animal.
I am looking for a solution that does not involve putting a fence around my garden patch.  Are there plants that raccoons are repelled by?  Has someone tried prickly plants to make the patch unattrative to raccoons?  I am told these are very intelligent animals, so I think the solution will have to be a mix of good ideas.


When the corn is about 1-2 weeks from being ready for human consumption put a battery powered radio tuned to an all night talk radio station in your corn patch.  Music does not work.  The raccoons will avoid the ""humans"" for a while.  You have to time this carefully to your corn crop because after a couple of weeks the 'coons will figure that those voices they hear are not really people.  You have to have your corn harvested before then.

My solution for large omnivorous varmint problems (opossums and skunks, here) is a Havahart trap.  I release them far from anyone's home, a few miles away.  I've gotten rid of over a half-dozen opossums and a half-dozen skunks with it.
You need to use bait that's specific to what you're trying to catch.  You don't want to catch Fluffy from next door.  For racoons, marshmallows are a good choice - except that skunks like them too.  I can explain how to deal with skunks if needed.
The nice thing about this solution is that it's semi-permanent - till the next varmint moves in.

3134,"In another question I was advised to use pea gravel for french drains.
Now, as it happens, a previous owner put down a lot of weed matting and covered it with perhaps 5cm of gravel.  My best guess, from looking at this page, is that the gravel is equivalent to 3/8"" crushed stone.  Can I use that instead of pea gravel?


Crushed gravel is the media of choice for providing drainage.  What you want is to have the maximum amount of airspace in the drainage layer so water has somewhere to go.  Normally you would use 5/8"" or even 7/8"" crushed gravel but 3/8"" will do.  Pea stone gravel would not be my first choice as it will pack down over time and provide less airspace than the irregular shapes of crushed gravel.
If you want to be diligent you can give the gravel you dig up a quick wash to separate out any dirt or other loose material.
And, when in doubt, add more drainpipe with sleeve!  There is no reason you cannot have several layers of drainpipe on top of each other in particularly difficult to drain areas.

3135,"In the office there is an abundance of fluorescent light and that's about it. The temperature stays around 70 ºF (21 ºC)  I think.
Could I grow a fruiting plant in these conditions? I may be able to add a lamp with a full spectrum light bulb to help the plant out.  It can't be anything fancy though.
I was hoping I could grow a small hot pepper plant, but I don't mind if I have to settle for something else.


You can probably get a number of fruiting plants to flower and set fruit once indoors.  I have seen coffee plants, citrus and members of the fig family flower and set fruit or seed indoors under fluorescents.  
The problem is that flowering and fruiting takes a lot of energy.  If the plant does not have more illumination than standard indoor light levels allow this comes from energy stored in the roots.  The usual issues with growing indoors also apply, low humidity, lack of pollinators.
I believe you would be most successful with a citrus plant like a Calamondin orange.  If you can grow it in a high light area next to a window during the flowering then you could sustain in under fluorescents during the fruit cycle.
"
3137,"I'm growing some seedlings in a tray that has a plastic lid. The sun causes moisture to condense on the lid. I was wondering: is this counter-productive, as the condensation then blocks the sun? 



In general, seed trays should be uncovered when you have full germination, or you can lift seedlings into other flats as they germinate.  An anti-fungal can be sprayed or sprinkled on the seed before planting and/or just on the soil surface.  I use ground cinnamon and have never lost a plant to fungus.  In the case of raising orchids, cinnamon should always be used.

3146,"I would like to build a paver patio next to a large tree that has a 3"" wide root at ground level.  I do not want to damage the roots of the tree, so it seems like my only option is to build a raised paver patio.  If I do build a raised paver patio what material should be used for the perimeter? I assume the roots will be a problem when building the perimeter, for instance if I need to bury the perimeter 4"" deep how do I deal with roots that may only be 1"" deep?  Am I putting the tree at risk by burying the surface roots under a patio?  I've considered building a raised deck instead, but I would really prefer a paver patio.  Are there any other options for dealing with a situation like this?
Thanks for the help.
Edit: I believe the tree is a New Zealand Christmas tree.  It's 20'-25' tall.  The patio would be about 5' away from the trunk.


Established trees like things just the way they are.  I killed a tree by doing just what you are planning.  The reason that trees don't take well to grade changes is that most of their roots are within 6"" of the surface.  An substantial amount of gas and water exchange goes on in the soil near the surface.
If you build over the roots it is like putting a blanket on someone's face.  The tree roots cannot breathe.
Roots will grow out as least as far as the drip line of the branch farthest from the trunk. If you still want to build a patio you should not cover more than one third of the total area under the drip line of the tree. The roots will die in this area but will regrow.

3149,"I've heard that coffee grounds are a good ""green""(nitrogen rich) to put in your compost, but I was wondering if I could throw the filter in there as well?  They are the standard ""accordion side"" white ones.


The paper ones? Sure - they're just like blotting paper and break down quickly. The usual things that can make some papers questionable should not be present (plastic coatings, metal and/or oil based inks) - or if they are present, you need to quickly change your filter brand!
What I would probably do if possible, is to try and tear the paper a little so that it all mixes up more easily and quickly.

Yes, you can add coffee grounds with their filters to your compost pile. Because they are wet, they decompose fairly quickly. The filters may dry out you if leave them on top of the pile in dry weather. Keep it inside the pile and keep it moist. Also, worms compost the grounds and filters very fast. I have a five tray worm factory and I just drop the whole filter with the grounds in and close the lid, and my army of five thousand redworms eat it in less than a week. I found filters to be easy to compost in almost any composter. If you have a two week ComposTumbler you will want to shred them before you add them, to keep it even.

3157,"I found what looks like a good raised vegetable garden soil mixture: 1/3 top soil, 1/3 compost manure, and 1/3 peat moss. Should I go by weight or volume?

In addition, I've read something about ""food grade"" materials (usually regarding plastic) for this use. If the containers are not designed for growing good, how can I determine whether the material is suitable?


Restaurant supply houses offer a wide variety of food grade equipment that can be repurposed.  I also see food grade containers like totes and olive barrels available at my local recycler.
A supplier like this has a wide selection however they are not pretty.  If you want something that does not look industrial you need to find an outdoor pond or even a koi supplier.

3180,"I have a clear 100 foot north-south swath through a wooded lot.

I live in Austin, TX and it gets damn hot in the long summers.
Thank you.


In your area, if you have to cut part of the light back, It would be best to cut it off the end of the day. Why? Well, starting at the beginning of the season, we find that fruit trees need their morning sun to get them warmed up for the day. In an area that has only afternoon sun the trees are noticeably behind others grown in morning sun. In summer, The trees will benefit from the shade in the afternoon, especially in your area. Fall and winter benefits would be minimal. If you were living in Vermont I would definitely advise planting in afternoon sun.

Bearing in mind the ""limited time"" and ""new baby"" factors I would suggest:
Courgettes

What is PVP? Plant Variety Protection (PVP) is a patent on a sexually propagated plant variety. PVP protects rights of ownership for the people who develop and release a cultivar for a period of 20 years.

3200,"In May, I took some greenwood forsythia cuttings, dipped them in a hormone rooting powder and planted them in rooting mix. The mix was kept moist all year. I had thought they had rooted because they began to grow rapidly and the new shoots hardened off. In October the plants dropped their leaves, and by November they were dead. I dug them up and they had not rooted. There wasn't even a trace of root. What caused it to do this and how do I prevent it?


I don't think the problem is forsythia specific - I've had the same experience with peach cuttings. The first time I tried it I took the cuttings at the wrong time of year (ie. a different unrelated problem), but the second time I took them at the right time and I had one success out of about half a dozen cuttings.
All of the failures in the second batch showed some leaves. Many were either too small (possible a problem specific to peaches where a cutting should be a minimum size); or with the larger cuttings when I dug them up, any roots had rotted away and the stem was beginning to rot. I believe this is your problem. The rot (or mold - rot is after all usually a kind of mold) is due to too much moisture. In your case you describe the mix as being moist all year - so it was probably too moist.
In my case I probably had more variability (outside, Texas, hand watering) - so it was probably too moist at a critical time.

3205,"I have quite a few daffodils planted around the perimeter of my garden, and although I see them spreading each year, I was wondering whether I could help thicken the daffodil border without buying new bulbs.
Should I dig up bulbs and split them? Or is that likely to damage them?
Is there something else I should do to encourage spreading?


I do this in early fall after the year's growth has died down, but before they start their winter growth. I dig up the entire clump, and do either of two options:

Pull it into several evenly sized pieces(whatever size you need) and replant to the same depth, without removing the earth from the bulbs. 
Remove the earth from the bulbs, clean it and trim the tops and roots. Then sort them and replant the large bulbs along the border. The smaller bulbs can be discarded or planted as a filler between the big bulbs, to grow to blooming size in the row.

3206,"I have a pretty steady access to about 4 pots of coffee worth of coffee grounds each day. I have heard coffee grounds are great for a compost pile, but I am wondering how much is too much? Is there a good ratio to maintain between coffee grounds and other compostable material?


If you add enough carbon, then you can't really put too many grounds in. 
Coffee grounds are 20 carbon to 1 nitrogen or 20/1. A good ratio is 30/1 for aerobic composting, So lets say you use leaves to compost the grounds with. leaves are 50/1, so a mix of 66.67% coffee grounds to 33.33% leaves would be a good mix. Remember that this is by weight, so shredding the leaves will help make it easier to measure. Of course the condition of the material can change the ratio, but it is always safer to put in too much carbon than too much nitrogen. You can use any high-carbon material; I only used leaves as a quick example. 
"
3208,"I'm sure I've heard before that the time to harvest potatoes is when the flowers fall off. Is that right or is it more complicated than that? For example, does it differ based on climate or variety, etc.?


Every time I've grown potatoes, there's been a day when the plants as a whole just all collapse. Distressed, I've dug up to see what's going on, and ended up with perfectly nice potatoes. If that doesn't happen to you, then do it before a frost, because potatoes aren't one of those vegetables that is nicer for frost exposure.
(Actually I grow them in a stack of tires, so ""dug"" isn't quite the right word, but ""knocked over"" doesn't make sense without the context.)
Given the size difference between ""new potatoes"" and ""ordinary potatoes"" in the store, and the historical role of potatoes as an everyday staple, I'm pretty sure there's a huge range of acceptable harvest times. The only downside of too early is that you might have got more by waiting. So don't do all the plants at once until you know you're done for the year - either because the plants have died or because there's a frost coming.
"
3210,"I'm sure I've heard before that the time to harvest potatoes is when the flowers fall off. Is that right or is it more complicated than that? For example, does it differ based on climate or variety, etc.?


If you harvest when the flowers fall you will get a more tender potato, better for frying and boiling. If you wait until the tops are dried, you get the best storage potatoes, better for mashing and baking. Harvesting over time is easier on you and gives a steady supply.  
Also, there is nothing wrong with frost on the vines at maturity, because the vines are useless to the plant at that time. The vines are going dormant like most other perennials do near the hardest time of year. Frost might make the vines dry out, but you don't need to worry unless you are going to get a hard freeze. You will want to harvest the rest of your potatoes before the hard freezes start.

3218,"An advertisement of Zephirine Drouhin rose said that this rose was disease resistant, shade tolerant, alkaline soil tolerant, pollution tolerant, more floriferous than other varieties, and completely thornless. I suppose they are probably being optimistic about it: I would especially like to know about the thornlessness. Are these really completely thornless?


I have a Zephirine Drouhin Rose that has been growing in USDA zone 4 for two years.  It puts on a great show, grows fast, resistant to powdery mildew but it is not thornless.
Compared to the shrub roses I have you can work with it without gloves.  There are not many thorns, perhaps one every inch on the larger stems only.  The thorns are a 1/4"" in length and as picky as you would expect.
"
3219,"Last year I grew aubergines (eggplants) and tomatoes with grafted rootstocks, and they actually produced a lot more veg than my other plants. 
Could someone tell me why it is done and why they produced more veg?


The principle is to combine the superior growing/rooting characteristics of the root stock with a graft either:

a. that cannot be grown from a seed (e.g. hybrid); and/or
b. whose roots/infrastructure is inferior to that of the rootstock in some way; and/or
c. whose flowers/fruit/leaves are superior to those of the rootstock in some way (e.g. better pest resistance, larger fruit, more fruit).

The fact that the graft produces more or better fruit than the rootstock would is simply due to genetic difference within the species or subspecies (i.e. tiny differences). The main reason why the graft is not just propagated directly by its own seeds is that the rooting and other infrastructure of that graft is known to be weaker and thus more vulnerable to weather, disease, etc, than the rootstock.

The proper answer is ""read the manual and do what it says"".  There is usually a list of maintenance that should be performed once a season.
Some common items:

Drain the fuel, or run it until it is empty.
Change oil
Check/replace spark plug
Replace air filter
Replace fuel filter
Scrape clippings from under the deck
Blade sharpen/balance, replace blade if necessary (do you have a torque wrench?)
Touch up any spots on the cutting deck with chipped paint and/or rust
Lube the wheel bearings
Lube the control cables
Put a tiny bit of oil in the cylinder and crank the engine a few times.

Many people skip a lot of these things.  How much did you pay for your mower?  How much is it worth to you to keep it in good condition?
I would also recommend NEVER using ethanol gas in your lawnmower as it leaves a residue like corn syrup on the carburetor.

There are a few common issues with citrus grown indoors.

I have seen them get 5 or 6 feet tall indoors, we are talking a plant that wants to be a tree!
If it gets enough light indoors normally the environment is dry enough to encourage spider mites.  Seeing your citrus webbed by mites is not a pleasant sight.  Higher humidity discourages mites. Soap and water will control but not eliminate an advanced infestation.
most soil less mixes popular for indoor mixes are ph neutral.  If you have alkaline water over time the soil mix becomes alkaline and nutrient deficiencies can show up.  The most common is the veins of the leaves are green and the rest of the leaf is yellow. Normally this is a deficiency in iron or manganese.  I deal with this by adding garden soil yearly.  It may be as alkaline as your water but seems to  have more accessible nutrients.

3232,"I recently wondered if I could compost peanut butter. I would assume it is fine since it is an organic material. If you can compost it, what are the pros and cons to doing so? Is there anything else I should know about adding peanut butter to my compost?


This question covers similar ground. See especially @baka's comment there:

the fats and oils slow down ""bug"" growth

If you are composting a little bit of peanut butter then it should be ok -- e.g peanut butter on a bagel that didn't get eaten and ends up in the compost bin.
But I wouldn't dump a whole jar of peanut butter into the compost. The issue is that peanut butter is mostly fat. Fat doesn't compost well. It will take longer to break down and will end up as a gooey, smelly mess in the meantime. It may also attract unwanted pests (raccoons, rats, neighborhood dogs, etc.).

3234,"Is it sensible and possible for a home gardener to attempt to create new cultivars (e.g. of citrus) via manual/controlled pollination in a home garden without specialist equipment?
For instance, if I wanted to cross two different apple cultivars is it easily achievable without using specialist equipment to prevent the flowers from being accidentally fertilised by the wrong pollen?


Yes, it is doable. The more crosses you do, the more likely you will come up with something good. The more cultivars that exist for whatever you are breeding the less likely you will come up with an improvement.
Smaller plants would be amenable to home breeding. Large trees like apples would be difficult to come up with an improvement over other varieties.

3237,"Why are my dwarf double yellow daffodils putting out flower buds? It's January, and they usually start that in March. They could get damaged by cold and wildlife during winter. Anyone know what is going on? The winter has been about average, except for the roller coaster temperatures (warm one day, freezing the next).



Have you had unseasonably warm weather in the past few weeks? (we have down here in Texas). Unseasonably warm weather will often 'trick' plants into producing new leaves and/or flowers early. The real problem occurs if there's a frost which kills new buds/growth (I suspect daffodils are less prone to that than, say, fruit trees).

3246,"I have these white bugs that seem to be falling down from the tree over where I park my cars. They have feathery tendrils and are staining our cars with white drops.

The first picture is what I originally saw. This had a larger body, with long white thread-like tendrils.
The next picture had what looks like a woolly aphid (on the left) and a variation of the first type I saw. This is the first time I saw one with wings. The one on the right has a very small body, but very similar tendrils to the first.



The description sounds like woolly aphids, and from some combined detective work are most likely Woolly Alder Aphids. 
One way to get rid of them would be to introduce a natural predator. Ladybugs could be your best bet - although then you may end up with a ladybug infestation. Amazon has them for pretty cheap if you decide to go this route.

3251,"I have a succulent plant that got some disease and is covered with holes. The holes started to appear a month ago. At first they were green (like something was eating it), probably growing and then they dried out and turned brown.
There are no bugs/insects around. Ants are everywhere in my garden but not on this tree. What is it and how can I treat it?



This looks like anthracnose to me. The picture shows some typical symptoms:

no yellowing leaves
round sunken areas that are not soft or rotting but look brown, even bark like
anthracnose is also common in Australia in many major crops such as mangos, olives, lupins, avocados, pistachios 

Treatment

easy way: cut the diseased tissue off with a knife or pruners. After each cut pass it through a flame or dip it in medicinal alcohol. Keep cutting until no diseased tissue is visible. Avoid fertilizer, as sometimes, lush new growth is more susceptible
hard way: do all of the above and apply chemical control by spraying with Saprol (0.15%), Maneb powder spray (0.2%), Dithane, or Orthocid 50.  Personally, I would rather throw the plant out than use this stuff again.

3254,"I got one of these snazzy paper pot makers and made a ton of pots to grow all sorts of stuff.

I put a little bit of masking tape on them just to keep it together until I filled them with dirt.  
What should you do with the pot when you plant it to make sure the seedling had the optimum chance of growing and the roots take... root in the soil?


In addition to keeping any sprouts wet while waiting to plant, you should thoroughly saturate the pot itself just prior to putting in the ground. It is also recommended that you ""tear away the bottom half of the pot before placing the plant in its hole to exposes some roots to direct contact with the soil.(source)"" On the latter step I am not 100% sure it applies to all scenarios, but on the former step I have heard and seen (on manufacturer's packaging in particular) this advice repetitively.

Also, my city has a program that gathers wood that people are throwing away and shreds them into mulch.  It's free to take some and they'll fill up the back of your truck for you as many times as you want.  You end up with a random collection of wood...not sure if this really matters though.


I use pea straw (from field peas) everywhere up to 7cm (3"") deep. It's not necessarily the cheapest source of mulch but definitely cheap enough. The bonus is that little field peas sprout here and there due to the peas left in the straw and so if they're not in direct competition with a weaker plant I let them run their 30cm (1') course and improve the soil by adding nitrogen while doing all the things any other mulch does: retaining moisture, suppressing weeds and discouraging minor erosion over the summer.

I found this plant in my woods And would like the identification. It is a small woody evergreen that grows in dry soil in light to deep shade. It grows about 1 1/2' tall and has small clusters of small greenish white flowers terminally on new wood in summer.
Update pic: I replanted it in a lighter location, and the plant has shot up to about 3 1/2 feet, after I topped it off.



I think this might be wintercreeper or euonymus.  Although it is native to China it has naturalized in many parts of the eastern United States.  The leaves have light coloured veins, it is a creeper, evergreen and adaptable to a wide variety of soils.
It is this adaptable part of it's nature that leads to the recommendations to remove it as it it considered invasive and displaces native vegetation.
The most definitive identification is the pink round capsules that open to show red-orange arils (seeds).

3274,"I have read that one shouldn't compost nuts or peanut butter because of their high oil and fat content. I am wondering if the same thing goes for peanut shells? I have a lot of peanut shells and I hope I can compost with them rather than throw them away.



Yes, peanut shells are a fine high-carbon addition to your compost pile. Adding peanut shells to your compost will probably tend to dry it out, so make sure you either add water or use enough high-moisture ingredients (e.g. most kitchen scraps or coffee grounds). Also, if you're lacking in high-nitrogen ingredients, then they will take longer to compost.

Yes, peanut shells can be compostable, but be sure that there is no salt on them. Often peanut shells have been salted, and these should not be added to compost because the salt will stay in the soil and damage plants.

3283,"I'm considering growing some ginger on my window-ledge. Is ginger a hardy plant that is conducive to indoor cultivation? Also, will ginger root from the supermarket grow?


It grows well as a forced plant indoors, and will grow year after year if the rest period and fertilizer needs are met. The roots from the supermarket usually work but may have been sprayed by a growth inhibitor to keep them from sprouting. Make sure they have large containers and plenty of light. Rotating the pots once a week keeps them from growing one sided.

3286,"I'm considering growing some ginger on my window-ledge. Is ginger a hardy plant that is conducive to indoor cultivation? Also, will ginger root from the supermarket grow?


To add to jmusser's answer; I've had no problems growing grocery ginger (perhaps I was lucky with the growth inhibitor). You need a piece that is larger than about an inch and with complete ""buds"" or ""wrinkles"" (they look like wrinkles in the side of the ginger root).
Plant it horizontally - iirc I planted mine about 1-2in deep. And as jmusser says, use a large, deep pot.
I suspect my location lacked enough sun, but I believe my big mistake was not watering it frequently enough. When the plant died back I dug it up. The original root had been absorbed (rather like a seed potato does), but it had been replaced by lots of tap roots. These are vertical pointy things. So I think it was reaching down for water.

3295,"What is the most effective way to kill weeds that does not involve digging or killing other plants?

These weeders are best used between stepping stones and in brick walks. In a vegetable garden, the safest way to use them would be on the paths between raised beds. This tool is made for killing the weeds that come up in walks, patios, driveways, and in crevices in between hard nonflammable surfaces where hand weeding would be very difficult. If you have your vegetables spaced far apart and there is no dry plant matter on the ground, you could use it between them. Be careful not to get too near the vegetables. You may want to water the garden when you are finished because of soil dehydration. It might be faster just to use a hoe.

3332,"Many of my perennial garden plants have been getting eaten by some animal. Possible culprits include deer, rabbits, and groundhogs. I would like to control them, but I have to know what I am controlling. for example, I don't want to start trying to control rabbits when deer are the problem. How can I find out what is eating them so I can match control to culprit?


If you have soft soil around the plants that are being eaten, you can figure out what the animal is by looking at the tracks left behind -- the difference between a rabbit and a deer will be obvious.
Height is another differentiator. Groundhogs, for example, are unlikely to eat the tips of the branches of your apple tree that are 4' off the ground. Voles might attack from underground.
Droppings are the last way I know of to figure out what is eating plants. Last summer, for example, I thought I had a woodchuck sneaking through a gap in my fence and nibbling on my peas. But when I patrolled the fence looking for the gap, I found skunk turds.
If you find tracks or droppings that you aren't familiar with, a google image search will usually turn up something useful.

I have a pile of about 4 bushels of spruce needles, and want to use them. Is there a way to compost them to use on garden plants? Do I have to add lime or ashes or other alkaline material? I know I will have to add a lot of nitrogen.


Pine needles are only about 80:1 C:N ratio -- about the same as straw or hay. If you mixed the needles in layers with high nitrogen material it should compost reasonably well.
You're right about acidity. ""The Rodale Book of Composting"" suggests using the resulting compost on acid-loving plants like blueberries. If you don't have plants that would do well with acidic compost, they discuss using lime in the compost pile on p80  -- recommending adding lime to the soil when adding the compost instead of mixing it into the pile. This is especially true if you're using manure.

3370,"Most people are aware that once you've had foods out of the freezer and allowed them to thaw, you shouldn't put them back in your freezer.
But what about frost hardy plants like leeks?  I've just harvested some old onions, leeks and carrots and who knows how many times they've been frozen in the ground, then thawed out.
Is this OK?


I think the advice to not re-freeze anything has more to do with the structure of the produce being broken down by the ice crystals (the cell walls burst from the pressure or the ice crystals cut through) and you end up with a ""mushy"" (highly technical term) vegetable. This can also lead to freezer burn (parts of the vegetable dehydrated due to water loss). If the onions, leeks and carrots all look OK to you (mites, molds, fungi, etc), and pass the sniff test and aren't soft, then I see no reason the think they would be bad.

A raw root vegetable can sit at room temperature or slightly cooler for weeks and months without bacterial growth that will harm you. The same is not true of meat, cooked vegetables, and other things you're likely to have in your freezer. That's where the ""don't refreeze"" advice comes from - the food may have started to spoil, and you should therefore cook it and eat it quickly before it gets worse. Entirely different from whether a raw root vegetable happened to freeze or almost freeze.
Some vegetables are so much nicer after a frost that my parents had a rule that if you harvested them earlier (because you couldn't wait to eat them or there hadn't been a frost by a meal that called for them), give them a little time in the freezer. Parsnips, for example, are much sweeter after a frost.

3376,"It is at all possible to grow tea plants, particularly something like Camellia sinensis, not herbal teas, indoors with special lighting?  Specifically, I'm not taking about starting tea seedlings and the transplanting outside, but solely growing the plant indoors (from seed to mature plant).  
I live in North Dakota (hardiness zone 4), where I am far away from ever seeing a tea plantation outside my window, so (to the best of my knowledge) there isn't any way I would be able to plant tea outside.


Yes, in a pot you can bring it outdoors when it is warm and bring it indoors while it is cold. Tea is a zone 6 plant so it is relatively hardy and durable. It should survive your winter inside similar to how you would overwinter other plants.

3379,"I've always thought lichens were neutral to tree health, and I think they are attractive, but someone recently told me to get rid of them, because they will cause rot and harbor disease. Do they really do that? Is that why so many trees have hollow centers?


Lichens are considered to be neutral to tree health.  They are not symbiotes or parasites. They just hang around.....   ;)
However a tree in poor health may not be able to grow new bark faster than lichens can encrust it.  Normally no control measures are necessary for lichen.  Stimulating the tree by feeding, mulching, watering and applying a foliar feed is usually enough.
In regards to the common sight of a tree with a hollow centre this is due to the different way trees grow than people.  A person with a hollow centre would be....hungry or dead but a tree only uses the centre of it's trunk for mechanical support and food storage.  All the living tissue is contained within a cylinder running up the trunk.  The tissue is surrounded by protective bark and backs onto the storage area in the interior.  If the interior rots out it is like not having an attic or basement. You can still live in your ""home"".

3386,"I am aware that different plants thrive/need different pH levels to grow.  What is it about the alkalinity/acidity of the soil that effects how a plant grows?
Note: I understand that this could have an in-depth answer about plant biology; but I am speaking a more basic level - not on the mechanics of molecular biology.


Soil pH affects the availability of nutrients to plants. At values outside the range of about 5-7, certain nutrients become unavailable to plants. (The Wikipedia article gets into more of the details of the chemistry, which are somewhat outside the scope of this site.)
For most plants in a home garden or landscape, you want to target a pH of about 6.0-6.5. There are some exceptions (blueberries, the azalea family, etc. like much more acidic soils).

My plant is taking over my garden and I would like to get things a bit more organized.  I've seen a cone type trellis where it's narrow at the base and expands toward the top.  I'm just not sure if that type of trellis is ideal for cucumbers.


I have raised beds and I always plant several hills of cukes. What really worked well for me was to plant the cukes near the outside of the raised beds and use cattle panel for the trellis. Cattle panels are quite large so I cut them in half and then bend each half into an ""A"" frame. I place one end of the bent panel on the side of the raised beds and the other end on the ground outside of the raised bed. As the cukes begin to grow, I weave them into the panel and they will continue to grow up and over the top of the panel (away from the bed). The fruit will hang off the vines underneath the panel making them really easy to see and pick.

3392,"Hydroponics is the method of growing plants in a soil-less medium.  I've always wondered, how does someone grow a mainly root/bulb-based vegetable (potato, turnip, onion, etc) in a hydroponic environment?


""Soil-less"" doesn't necessarily mean ""liquid"", though I often think liquid when I hear hydroponics.
See, for example, this page on growing hydroponic carrots:

Medium hydroponics systems require a physical substance for the vegetables to grow in (in this instance, perlite), whereas solution hydroponics systems only require a liquid nutrient solution.

Essentially you just use perlite or some other soil-less medium in order to support the roots.

What can I plant that will attract butterflies and other pollinators? I am in Minnesota.
Also See: What steps can I use to encourage pollination?


@kevinsky's answer is excellent. I would also mention that different plants bloom (and attract pollinators) at different times. If you want to attract pollinators for help with, say, your June strawberry crop, then sunflowers (which bloom late) are a poor choice -- Lupines might be better.
Because of the differing bloom times and possibly preferences of different pollinators, it would be a good idea to plant a wide variety of species. Then you can start attracting pollinators early in the season and keep them around for longer.
In addition to kevinsky's list, also consider Monarda (bee balm) as a candidate. You can get very hardy varieties that will survive a Minnesota winter. Ours grow about 4' tall and when in bloom attract tons of bees and butterflies.

I live in an area that you need to winterize so I want to make sure I do it right.  Suggestions?


You've got to do some digging no matter what, so you don't need any special trick for this.  Just dig up around each of the heads to see where the line is going.  Trace the line from end to end to see if it stops or keeps on going.
If it doesn't continue beyond that area, you'll want to remove this part of the line from the system so that it doesn't freeze and leave a leak.  Find the last sprinkler head in the chain that is not going to be removed and swap out the T for an L joint.  I'll leave it up to you whether you want to remove all the old line or not.
If the line continues, cap all of the T's or remove the T's and replace them with a straight piece of PVC.
Either way, be sure to save the old sprinkler heads.  You never know if you'll need to replace one somewhere else.

It's like any other DIY project. It's a time/money issue. That said, it sounds like you are doing MAJOR landscaping. To do all you listed will likely take you years DIY (especially retaining walls...they aren't for the faint of heart). If that's OK, I say go for it. Keep in mind that you really can't get irrigation figured out until you have the plan for the landscaping finished. I'm not sure you want the irrigation done first. Typically, you'd be adding it as needed as you go. Otherwise you're dealing with other projects interfering with your already installed irrigation system.

What are the regulations in your area regarding permits for irrigation systems? In many municipalities, irrigation work now requires a construction permit, which must be pulled by a tradesman with the appropriate license -- in my area, this is a master plumber with an irrigation license. 
The reason for this is back flow prevention. Irrigation systems are extremely common paths for fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals to enter your home or city water supply. The irrigation license requirement means that The city has the guarantee that the irrigation system will be installed correctly. If they find an irrigation project that a license was not pulled for, then they will require you to tear it out. 
If your city has this requirement, you cannot DIY this project.

Consider hiring a professional to do the hard part. My parents had a sprinkler system installed in their yard when I was in middle school. They hired out the trench-digging and installation, but didn't pay to have the professionals back-fill the trenches.

Doing it this way saved some money and allowed my parents to inspect the job done by the professionals.

3418,"I live in northern Indiana and it is currently snowing. I want to add worms to my garden.  Should I wait for it to warm up, start raining, or what?


It is best to add worms when the ground is thawed out long enough to let them get safely into the subsoil where it will not freeze. It can be done day or night at any temperature above 35 degrees Fahrenheit, if the ground is thawed. Worms will not tolerate freezing. They will get safely underground in an hour at most. If you have your worms ready and the weather doesn't permit putting them into your garden, you should put them in moist peat moss in a plastic freezer bag in the refrigerator. The cold will slow their metabolisms and lower their food consumption. They will survive on the peat until you can put them outside. You can bury them, but be careful not to put them too deep if your soil is heavy, or they will be crushed. Even active compost will cool off pretty fast, when applied in a several inch layer on frozen ground, so compost would mainly help the worms after a thaw.

3425,"I have a reticulation system in my lawn. Recently I replaced some of the sprinkler heads. But they don't always retract; ie when the water pressure is reduced or off they stick up above the lawn.
The head is brand new and has been in for around a month and doesn't retract. They look like this:

Is this because I got cheap sprinklers or does it means there is dirt in the system?


These type of sprinkler heads typically have a spring inside of them that pulls the head back down when there is no water pressure to be pushing them up. When they don't pull down, there is either something jamming the head, like dirt getting in there, or the spring just isn't pulling hard enough.
Since these are new heads, there is a chance they might just be cheap and don't have great springs in them. You can try to unscrew the sprinkler at the part that is in the middle of your picture. When you do this you should be able to see the spring in there. You might just need to play with it to see if you can find anything wrong. If you still have no luck, then you might just have to go buy a new head.

Our climate is dry and there is no direct light on the rocks.  Would I need lighting and some way of misting the moss daily?  Any ideas on how best to do this?


If your fireplace is used regularly you may find it difficult to get moss started - it grows best in outdoor alpine conditions (ie cool/cold, shaded, damp)
That said, you could bring some established moss inside to try on one of the rocks furthest from the fire, and possibly run a fine sprinkler system to keep the stones damp.
I have seen a setup for something similar where a low pressure water feed dripped onto the rock continuously, but at very low volume, providing just enough moisture for a fern/moss bed.

Buy one large tarp. You can easily buy a 30x40 foot tarp for under $100. I saw one on Amazon for $59. You would probably spend that much money on chemicals anyway. 30x40 feet is 1200 square feet, or 1/4 of the square footage of your yard. So kill off one rectangle of weeds. This will take a few weeks. Then move the tarp to a new spot. After 4 placements of the tarp, the entire lawn is done. Clean up any small spots in the corners with a hoe.
And, if you look around, you might be able to find a larger tarp. I did just look, and I found a silver/black poly tarp for $65 that was 30x50 feet, so 1/3 of the footage of your lawn.

Our yard was much smaller (less than 1000 sq/ft), but the solution worked well: I rented a gas-powered sod cutter, set it for a fairly deep setting and cut off the entire layer of grass/weeds. It's pretty hard work (especially hauling the sods pieces away). 
This method avoids pushing weed seeds farther into the ground as would happen if you just roto-tilled. After cutting the sod, I tilled and then planted grass seed. 
4,500 sq. ft is a ton of sod though...

Vinegar works pretty well.  Spray down, and within a few days they should be dead.  I'd follow it up after a few days with a rototiller, rake, and seed.

Good answers above. But one is missing:
Torch your weeds.
You can build your own torch (um, dangerous) or purchase one such as the Red Dragon.
But beware. According to this worthwhile read at Bifurcated Carrots, you should not use a torch near dry brush or over mulch, both of which can be extremely flammable. Also, a torch may not kill weeds that have matured past the cotyledon stage.

What seems to be the most effective method (chemical, or a technique based, etc; doesn't need to be a specific product) of removing fire ants without harming or hurting any neighboring vegetation? Also, please provide a reason why.
We don't have any trees (How do I control fire ants in the mulch around my tree?) in the backyard thus the reason for this post.


Ed Staub's answer here is appropriate and relevant. And this comment on Ed's post is informative.  Who knew those little red guys had their own web site?
My take on the information is that chemical methods are common and available.  Organic bio control is available in some areas.  Home grown remedies seem to be ineffective and potentially dangerous.
Good luck!

Further to the suggestion of goats, I had a large patch of Spiderwort (Tradescantia fluminensis) which was taken care of by two young hens within a couple of weeks.
You could try the chicken tractor method or just let them roam around.
There are many benefits to this method:

Free chicken feed
Free eggs
Improved soil
Chickens will do a good job of getting not just the tops of the plants, but they will scratch up the roots

With the Spiderwort the chickens were quite interested in eating it and it has hardly come back at all this warm season (in Australia) leaving a few small plants which I could easily remove by hand.
The only thing I would mention is to do some research to make sure the weed you have there is not toxic to animals.

3463,"In general, do most seeds require/do better with bright light when germinating indoors?  I am trying to germinate a variety of seeds indoors (basil, chives, spinach, pepper) and am curious if no lighting (just warmth) is sufficient or if it would be better to use artificial/indirect sunlight?


Some seeds will germinate with just warmth and water but if they do not get sufficient light they become spindly and stretched out.  These seedlings are weak stemmed and tough to plant out.
You get better seedlings by growing them under light. Once they are around the two leaf or four leaf stage you can take the top off your tray and move them into indoor sunlight if you wish but if you let them dry out then it's all over! I prefer to keep mine in high humidity and bright artificial light for four to six weeks and then take outside to harden off in some shade.  
From a technical point of view most seeds only need water and air to germinate but if you are looking to get the best results they should have at least eight to ten hours of light and as much as eighteen to twenty hours of light from the moment they are sown.

3469,"I have no experience in gardening. I have a pot of Calla lilies but I have no idea how to take care of it. It came with a label that suggests keeping it at a sunny place. But apart from that, I don't know anything else. How often should I water it? How big and deep should the pot be? When should I transfer it to a bigger pot? Is there anything else I should know?


Here is some basic info on how to keep your plant healthy:

Keep the soil moist, but not wet. Test this with your finger. If the potting mix is dry more than 1/2"" deep, water thoroughly until water drains from the bottom of the pot.
Transfer to a larger pot if the plant becomes rootbound. Test this by removing from the pot, and looking at the root-ball. If it looks like a mass of circling roots, and you can't see much soil, it's time to repot. Use a pot one size larger, and add high quality organic potting mix as required.
Fertilize once every other week with a balanced, soluble fertilizer with the watering. This promotes healthy growth and flowering.
Locate in a bright location out of direct sun. They don't like direct sun, as it can burn the leaves. 
Calla lilies overheat easily. don't place them in a location that gets over 75 degrees F. on a regular basis, or they won't thrive.

3477,"My lawn has both peaks and troughs. I guess that I can just fill the troughs with lawn soil or compost, right?
But how do I flatten the peaks? 
I’ve read that a water filled roller does nothing. 
Has anyone been successful at flattening out an established lawn or do I have to rip it out and re-sod?  


It depends how big they are. For small bumps a roller is very effective, but for larger humps you may need to try one of the following:

cut the turf up, peel it back, take out sufficient soil (this is relatively easy to get close to flat...not so easy to get exactly right)
take the turf off entirely, flatten all the soil and re-lay the turf (bigger job, but gives best results)

Your profile says you live in Ohio. A quick google search leads me to the OSU Extension Service -- note that the form indicates that Penn State's lab actually does the testing.

Of course you can compost it! 
Clay soil improvement (@uncle brad) is another possibility. 
I use it to fill small lawn gaps (I'm not into the bowling green quality lawns!) or to help top up raised beds (where the bulk goes).
The only thing to watch for would be possible disease. You may want to discard it if you had some serious disease (or nematode) problems in the plants which were in it. There the best thing would depend on the disease - a good hot compost heap may be sufficient to sterilise it.

3499,"I would like to know which edible plants can actually root from twigs and/or leaves put in water or a similar setup? Is it as simple as leaving them in water or do you need chemicals to induce rooting? 


Theoretically you can induce most slips (of an asexually reproducing plant) to root in just water as long as the water is extremely aerated, the right temperature and the proper pH.  Most plants that can reproduce asexually don't need nutrients from soil to start roots for a limited time.  Once they slip/seed has used up its stored energy source it will need nutrients added to the water or to be transplanted to the soil.  
These are the vegetables/fruits that I know of that can be grown asexually:

Asparagus
Rhubarb
Potatoes
Sweet Potatoes
Garlic
Shallots
Horseradish
Jerusalem Artichokes

Note: You can start any plant hydroponically/aeroponically and then transplant it to soil later.

3517,"I am in the process of starting a small garden (6'x9'). My current sprinkler system doesn't do a great job of covering the area where I have placed the garden, so I would like to tap off of my existing system to add a head dedicated for the garden.
How tall should I make the head for this garden? Should I place it several feet above the ground so that it is able to get over some of the taller plants, like tomatoes? Also, is it better to place one single head for the whole thing or a few heads with less pressure around the garden? Or is there some better method for automated watering of this garden? I would like to have most everything underground while having to perform minimal amounts of digging to get it underground.


If you design your garden with the tall stuff around the perimeter, a single head just needs to be high enough to loft over the nearest plants - really high for corn, not so much for chives.  
To reduce evaporation loss, mulch and use a head that puts out big droplets.
I don't use an automated system, so I can't help you with the specifics on that.  FWIW, I use a little square-pattern sprinkler on our 16' by 16' garden - the simple kind that's just a bunch of holes in a domed metal plate.  It puts out big droplets with very little mist.  It's on a little platform that's about two feet high.  We have trellising all around the perimeter, for tomatoes, cucumbers, pole beans, peas, etc.

In zone 7-8 Sweet Potaoes go in around June 1 or after.  The time depends how many steps you are doing.  We started with organic potatos from organic grocery store, cut up and planted those to make sprouts, that was about 3-4 weeks.  Then we cut vines off those sprouts, placed in buckets of water outdoors 2 weeks or so, then planted each of those rooted slips in the field rows.  The whole process only took about 6 weeks.

3533,"Stevia Plants, to be precise their leaves are being used as a natural sugar substitute in some countries like Japan, India and over South American for decades or centuries now.

More information here.
Q: Where can I buy Stevia seeds?! It seems, after several approaches to get my hands on the seeds, that i either asked the wrong people, they never heard about it or couldn't point me in the right direction. Right now I live in Frankfurt, but anyway online resellers are just fine with me!
Also, if anyone of you is experienced, in growing this particular plant from seeds, feel free to give me some advice of how to do it right. 


Stevia seems to be widely available in North America.  Examples include Vesey's or Richters 
The issue seems to be that plants grown from seed can have widely varying amounts of the sugar substitute. Seeds can normally be shipped across the world but live plants are subject to phytosanitary certificates which are a lot of work for an individual.  Your best choice would seem to be growing from seed and selecting for the sweetest leaves.  You can grow them indoors but an plot of well drained soil with rich loam will give the best results

Not really, an indoor plant does not have the same ecosystem in the soil that an outdoor plant does.  Hopefully you do not have worms, slugs and snails in the soil of your plant.  These are the agents of recycling outside.
You are better off to pick up the dead stuff and apply a dilute fertilizer to replace the nutrients lost.

You are right. It's generally accepted that chicken manure is a fine addition to compost, with the caveat that, as you mention, it should cure for 6-12 months. Chicken manure is high in nitrogen, and if you have a good mix of ""browns"", it will help the pile get hot quickly.
I regularly add small amounts of poultry manure (from about 2 dozen birds) to my pile of horse manure and stall bedding, and it makes excellent compost.

3572,"In https://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/421/138, the answer mentions ""Remember to harden off any indoor plants for a few days before transferring them outdoors.""  I assume this is something you would need to do to help them survive in the colder, more variable climate outside.  We're trying to grow tomatoes and peppers, both of which are supposed to be started indoors if I understand correctly.
How do I do that?
For what it's worth, we live in central Minnesota, so that's the climate they'll be moving out into.


Slowly get them used to their new environment. For tomatoes, This would mean placing the plants outside for an increasing amount of time each day until they are completely used to it. Start When the frost is past outside and the average outside low temperature stays above 45 degrees Fahrenheit. I usually put them out for an hour the first and second days, three hours the third day, five hours the fourth day, and keep going like that until it stays out from sunrise to sunset. Then plant it.

3573,"We are wanting to grow tomato plants from seed this year.  We've not done this before, so we have some questions.

And, what am I forgetting/not thinking about? (I am asking about hardening in a separate question, but I'm sure there are other considerations that I haven't even thought of asking about)


Tomatoes are very similar to peppers and I find they need similar conditions, although we find peppers have a longer growing season through our (hot) summers.
So following from this, I would start them in seed trays - probably 2 seeds per 'pocket'. This lets you start a large number in a small space. Using a larger pot with (say) six seeds could 'loose' them as it were, and take a lot of space, and be more difficult to keep moist.
Follow the instructions on the packet for depth/etc (for peppers they are barely covered).
I then plant them out when the seedlings are a couple of inches in size and after the last frost.
I would expect them to grow easily - from experience, tomato ""volunteers"" (ie. those we ate and were discarded in the previous year's compost pile) grow much better in our compost than peppers...

As the question says, I live in zone 4b and we're planning on zone specific vegetables & gourds, but want to know the best time to start growing them.


The best time depends more on your last frost date than your planting zone.
The planting zone tells you how cold it gets during the winter. The last frost date tells you when tender plants like squash and tomatoes can reliably survive outside.
You can look up your last frost date at this NOAA site. Gourds and other squash family should go out on or after the last frost date. Spinach and kale can go out as soon as the ground is open. Other plants fit somewhere in between, depending on how hardy they are.

I can see the definite advantage of being able to transplant without root disturbance. But you don't see much online discussion of their usage by serious gardeners, just a lot of craft/novelty/gimmicky ""hey, here's a simple idea"" pages.
Has anyone had any problem with these pots? Don't they disintegrate easily, especially with any kind of sustained watering?
I'd like the no-hassle transplanting but if I've got to rescue soggy, disintegrating pots half way through doing their job then that's no time/hassle saving at all.


I had no problem with them disintegrating, probably because I packed them tightly in a seed tray. However I found that fungus grew and spread quickly through the pots. I prefer giving the seedlings plenty of time before transplanting - if I planted on as soon as they sprouted it might be a different story.

3599,"I have read in various places that mushrooms in lawns are an indication of woody compostable material that is being eaten by the mushrooms and that the by-product of this process will be additional nutrients for the lawn.
Can this same process be used in a vegetable garden?  @bstpierre mentioned that mushrooms would compete well against the vegetable plants for the nitrogen in the soil in this question.  But if there is a lot of uncomposted material from the previous season (stems, roots, leaves, etc) lying on top of the garden (left there as mulch/soil amendment) can a balance be struck with mushrooms mostly feeding on the mulch and the plants eating the nitrogen in the soil?  What species of mushrooms would be good for this?  It would be nice if the mushrooms were edible.


Mushrooms like feeding on decomposing organic material under the surface of the ground that rarely gets disturbed, or above the ground in large pieces that are constantly internally moist. They like rich soil in shady locations. Of course this is your average mushroom. There are kinds that use different growing environments. But the point is that in a vegetable garden, the conditions are all wrong. A better idea would be to compost the material. The bacteria and fungi do the same thing as the mushrooms, but are by far easier to use than mushrooms. When you see mushrooms in your lawn, it means you have undecomposed organic material in the soil. The mushrooms have probably been working on them for a while before you saw the fruiting bodies emerge. Getting the mushrooms with a lawnmower will not hinder the composting process from continuing. And even if there were no mushrooms, little microscopic organisms would be eating it.

3608,"My Tomato plants seem to be coming along quite well:

The tallest (shown) is ~10cm tall above the soil and most of them are in square 6×6×6cm cardboardish pots (there are others off-camera, in varying numbers per pot). The 'target' pots (and only other pots available) I wish to have them finally grow in are circular, 21cm in diameter and 19cm tall.
Are these tomato plants ready to move in to my larger pots, if not when?
And how many should I put in each pot?
Oh, and in case that matters, the box tells me they are of the Gardeners Delight variety.


If you transplant from 6 x 6 cm pot to a 21 cm diameter pot the plants will put all their energy into growing new roots.  This will retard the growth of new leaves, particularly if you keep them indoors.  For many gardeners there are still a few weeks to go or more before tender seedlings are ready to go outside. 
If you are able to find an intermediate pot size of around 8 to 10 cm in diameter this should tide them over until they are ready to go outside.  A fruitful place to look for new pots is your plastic recycle bin.  Even a  one litre waxed paper container used for ice cream might do the job.

Another option not mentioned in the answers above is sowing directly into the ground.
I guess this depends on your climate and if you are trying to sow early and also the variety (due to the climate in my city we have suitable 'year-round' varieties).
About 8 weeks ago I put about 20 seeds into the ground (southern hemisphere) and had a near 100% germination rate which meant I had to pull out some of the seedlings to make room.
I spaced each seed about 20cm apart and about 60cm away in a second row of 10 seeds. The even spacing allows for me to lay down mulch (we are in summer here so locking in moisture) around the seedlings once they get about 5 - 10cm high.
When they reached the 5 - 10cm height I removed the excess seedlings so that my plants are now in two rows of 6 with around 50 - 60cm between plants and the second row.

I know I could just ask my neighbours, but I would like to get a wider opinion: Is it a good idea to plant some flowers amongst a veggie patch? I assume the aim is to increase pollination and thus improve yields.
What type of flowers make good companions?


Flowers are both a beneficial and attractive addition to a bed of vegetables. They have a variety of uses, depending on species. I always grow sunflowers in the veggies because they are attractive, thrive in the same conditions as vegetables, attract hordes of bees, and have tasty seeds at the end of the season. Some people grow flowers in among the vegetables solely for pollination, but others use the flowers artfully to create an eye pleasing picture. Good flowers for vegetable gardens are bright, long lasting annual plants that have a long blooming season. They should be upright, or climbing if you have a support, and preferably attract plenty of insects. Zinnias and Cosmos are some good ones. Also, some flowers, such as nasturtiums and marigolds, are good for companion planting with various vegetable crops as pest deterrent.

3626,"What are the best soil amendments for blueberries grown in containers?  What's the best mulch?  Last year I used chopped leaves from a friend's landscaping job that is no longer around.  I also remember hearing about adding coffee grounds to the soil to help with acidity.  I haven't tested the soil yet, but have a bunch of coffee grounds from a local coffee shop. Do they raise the ph so much that I shouldn't add them if I haven't tested the soil?


A good soil mix for pot grown blueberries is a porous, acidic mix high in organic matter. A good mix could be made by mixing these materials by weight:

5/8 topsoil
2/8 peat moss
1/16 vermiculite
1/16 coarse sand

Plus some slow release plant food. To help with the acidity, mix 1/4 pound of aluminum sulfate into the top 6"" of soil. There are several mulches that fit the needs of the blueberry bushes. Bark mulch is acidic, long lasting and attractive. Also, shredded wood, aged sawdust, and pine straw are good mulches. Coffee grounds are only very slightly acidic, so they will not be useful in maintaining ph. But they do make good compost, and if composted with an acidic material high in carbon, such as the mulching materials mentioned above, they would make an excellent mulch that would feed the plants and help maintain soil ph.

I am not sure you can get a really nice looking lawn fast.  Given the clay soil improvements take time and you might not feel your efforts had been well spent if it takes three or four years to make a perceptible difference.
Still there are inexpensive things you can do:

in the spring give the lawn a hard raking to remove the moss
aerate with a gardening tool that will remove plugs of soil, there are manual and roller types
apply lots of grass seed of a variety suited to the light conditions
top dress with one quarter inch of your choice of compost or top soil
water in, keep watering if the spring is dry until you see the new grass is established

If you do this every spring and fall the lawn will improve.  The goal is to improve aeration, increase the organic matter and increase the density of grass in order to shade out weeds and moss.

I don't think you can really go wrong with adding manure. Since this is a new garden in clay soil, you'll benefit from adding organic matter (the leaves and grass clippings are a good start), and composted manure will boost your soil fertility.
However, the only real way to know how how much fertilizer you should add is to get your soil tested. Your profile says you live in Utah. This document (pdf) from the Utah State University Cooperative Extension describes how to take a soil sample. It says they charge $10 for a standard test, which is a very reasonable price.

Also, will it harm my vegetables if I use Roundup on weeds growing in the garden if I'm careful not to get any on the vegetables themselves?


The ETOXNET (Extension Toxology Network) page at Cornell for glyphosate suggests it binds quickly to soil so that run off problems tend to be minor (2% being quoted as typical). Note however you are talking about irrigation ditches, so I would expect run off to be higher - although perhaps not by much if you treat the ditch whilst dry and a few days before rain.
Although glyphosate is the active ingredient of Roundup, much of the animal toxicity comes from surfactants used in the Roundup mixture - so a lot of the official toxicity reports tend to under-report the toxicity of Roundup (Monsanto have only submitted glyphosate for testing and not production Roundup mixes).

3680,"I have created a monster of a compost heap on my property (3 meters, by 2 meters, by almost 2 meters tall) next to an old granite rock wall. Anyway, I mostly put all my grass clippings (primary offended of volume of material) as well as leaves and other material. I just started doing this because I didn't think it would be good to have the local rubbish company haul this off.
As of late, the pile has started getting a bit bigger than I want it to, and it exudes a sickly sweet smell.  What can I do to speed up the decomposition of all this vegetation?  I don't mind the smell that much, since it's pretty far from the house.  However, will any process I initiate cause any other odours to come from it that may be more noticeable than the current smell?
I'm not after dirt, just trying to lessen my impact a bit (and stop that smell).
Will some of those organic disintegration agents work (like a stump dissolver)?


As @bstpierre mentioned, the pile you are working with is huge and suggested making it into smaller piles. You also said you don't want to use the results of your composting personally.
My suggestion is to take the material that is already well composted and place it bags and sell it on the sidewalk next to your house for a reasonable price. I have seen this done quite often where I live.
If I can get a whole bag of good quality compost for about $5 it is much better than spending $15 for the same quantity of poorer quality stuff from a store.
This way you are reducing the size of your pile, someone is getting good use out of your work and you can continue with your goal of lessening your impact.

Something I learned from my father for spreading tiny seeds like lettuce...

Fold a piece of light cardboard in half so that it forms a V shape.
Drop the seeds into the bottom of the V, spreading them out along the width of the card.
Hold the cardboard so that the bottom of the V has a slight downward slope away from where you're holding it.
Move slowly along the row, tapping the card gently.  If you do it right, you should have a few seeds bounce out with every tap.

The best thing is, you can practice this technique in a controlled place (like over a piece of paper on your kitchen table) to be sure you're doing it right, then gather up the seeds and do it again for real in your garden.
I find that this technique works even better for me than using the seed sower I use for larger seeds (like spinach):

You can glue seeds to paper napkins. Sounds weird, but I tried it last year with carrots and lettuce with mostly ok results.
I'm going to retry this year with toilet paper so I can have a nice, straight, long row of carrots.
It's somewhat time consuming to prepare the mats, but you get perfect spacing, and you can do it at night when there's no possibility for doing other garden chores. It also makes the outside part of planting time go very fast, which is critical for me because it's stressful to try to carefully space tiny seeds when the black flies and/or mosquitoes are sucking your blood. And it saves time on thinning, since the spacing is already correct.

As a former landscaper my favorite quote to clients was ""You can have it fast, good or cheap. Pick two."" In this situation I see a few solutions:

rent a Bobcat with a toothed bucket and remove all the grass and bumps to a dump bin. Apply six inches of topsoil mix, gently compact and sow grass seed or sod. That's fast and good.
top dress spring and fall to a depth of 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch with topsoil or compost, repeat until it's level.  That's good and cheap.
from Rory's answer here 


cut the turf up, peel it back, take out sufficient soil (this is

  right) ... re-lay the turf

That solution could be fast and cheap if you don't have a lot of area.

3711,"In the past, I grew some herbs which I harvest them when I see them grow out of space. Then I just cut the whole stem, then the plant will split in 2 ways growing in a Y shape. The next time it grew out of space, I cut the whole stem again, and produce another Y shape branch. Eventually its leaves become smaller and are too small to harvest.
Is this a bad way of harvest? Should I just take the leaves?


If you're growing indoors, I'd expect to need to replant non-woody leaf herbs like basil at least once a year, if not more.  For woody leaf herbs, like rosemary, you should be able to get several years.  
It's hard to give specific advice without a photo.  However, when you get to the point you describe, you probably need to do something drastic - a hard prune, repot, or start another.
If the plant has more than one stem, or has low branches that would ""volunteer"" to become a new stem, you probably occasionally want to cut back the main stem very hard when it stops being productive.  
If it's in a pot, consider the possibility that the plant is root-bound - has too much root for the pot.  In this case, you want to both cut it back (to reduce stress from repotting) and repot.

This year when I planted the garlic I did not amend the soil since I didn't have anything to use. Now that it’s coming up I’m wondering when this should be fertilized, and with what.
I have some bone meal and my local nursery has a bulb care product and some bio-tone starter plus available. Would any of these be ok to apply or is there a better solution?


Bone meal, like most phosphorous sources, is not mobile in the soil.  A plant has to grow towards it to use it.  I assume you are not going to dig up your garlic in order to add bone meal or bulb care at the roots.  
I actually never fertilize my garlic but what it could use in the spring is nitrogen for leaf growth. Nitrogen can be applied as a side dressing or a foliar feed.   The least amount of work would be to apply 1/2"" of compost to the plant.

I'm thinking about sowing lupins to cover the ground in the meantime. I think lupins would have the added advantage of growing relative quickly (as the seeds are large).
Are there any alternative winter cover crops that have allelopathic properties (so would prevent or slow growth of at least some of the weeds).
I'm in New Zealand, with a moderate climate. Temperatures will range roughly between -5 (overnight) and 15 C over the winter.


Winter rye is allelopathic, inexpensive, and very hardy. I don't know about suitability as ""pre lawn"". It can be challenging to kill in the spring when you're ready to plant. I rototill it once or twice, then wait a couple of weeks before trying to plant any seeds.
I'm not sure about sowing lupins -- it wouldn't work well for me because we'd be hitting -5°C and down to -20°C in midwinter, but perhaps in your climate they will grow enough in the fall. They have the added advantage of fixing nitrogen and being relatively easy to kill in the spring.

The raised bed is for convenience more than anything, so as for how high to make it, it's really up to you. The higher it is, the less you need to bend over. But also the more materials and effort that will go into building it.

Cedar would be the best, but it's expensive, and you may have a hard time finding it at your local big box store. Arsenic is no longer used for PT lumber, so at least from the few sources I've found PT wood appears to be safe for raised garden beds. You certainly don't want untreated wood since it will rot in no time.
For assembling, I'd used coated deck screws. Nails will pull out, and anything other than a hot dipped galvanized nail would react with the PT chemicals and corrode. The other advantage of screws is that you can remove them to disassemble the box in the future, especially if you need to replace one or more boards.
The deeper you build it, the more soil you need to fill it with, but the less you bend over. Make sure when sizing it that you don't make it so large that you can't reach part of the bed without stepping in it.

What are some tips on getting rid of the vines for good?  How can I ensure they don't come back?


Honeysuckle vines have very hard wood.  I have snapped sequiteur blades trying to cut a branch only 3/4"" diameter.  If you have a lot of old vines that have not been pruned I recommend an industrial approach.

rent a chainsaw and cut the vines back near the base.  (Be extremely careful not to snag the chainsaw on the fence.  Use hearing protectors, safety chaps, chainsaw gloves and eye protection.)
trench around each plant to a depth of a foot with a spade.  It helps to sharpen the edge of  the spade. 
the rest is just hard work to cut the roots around the base using loppers and lever out the stump
cleanup involves cutting the branches grown into the fence and filling in the holes
honeysuckle will not regenerate from the roots if you remove the bulk of the root ball

Will the decomposing plant matter promote disease in the tree or it's fruit?



Yes, heavy shade is fine.  In fact, it may be better, because the pile will dry out slower.
The compost and its leachates will be good for the tree.  I don't know about apples in particular, but the tree will grow roots up into the compost, and you'll need to keep cutting them. On balance, it still should be good for the tree.  It's a minor nuisance.  Don't let the roots get deep into the compost (say, 2-3 years without turning) and then cut all at once - that will stress the tree.
I don't know if it will promote disease in the fruit.  If concerned, you might avoid turning the compost while fruit is ripening, to avoid throwing up lots of mold spores.

Most tree roots are within 6 inches of the surface and extend from the trunk to the drip line because that's where the oxygen and water are.  If you raise the existing grade by more than an inch or two over more than two thirds of the rooting area there is a good possibility that the tree will decline as the roots starve for oxygen. 
This is most commonly seen in new construction areas where contractors put safety fencing around an established tree to ""protect"" it and then kill it by raising the grade a foot.
Younger trees have a better chance of growing new roots up into the compost but that's not what you want either.
I do not recommend putting a compost pile under the tree unless it occupies no more than twenty percent of the rooting area.

Wikipedia recommends: Aster Family flowers, Dill, Coriander, Tomatoes, Parsley, Basil, Comfrey, Marigolds.  Has anybody tried these combinations?  


From here, tomatoes are a logical companion to the asparagus, because the asparagus grows most actively in spring, and the tomatoes fill in later in the season as the asparagus becomes inactive. Also, the tomatoes repel asparagus beetles, which is a great help in summer. It is better to plant the tomatoes on the south side of the asparagus plants, as asparagus gets fairly tall, and will shade the tomatoes if they are on the wrong sides of each other. Marigolds also repel beetles. I personally like tomatoes, because it produces food almost all season.

Moss cannot compete with grass under ideal conditions for grass.  You could cultivate a moss garden. It never needs mowing!
To improve conditions for grass you can do some or all of these:

reduce compaction due to foot traffic or absence of organic matter

add a hard path where people walk
sow more grass seed and then top dress twice to 1/4"" to 1/2"" yearly with weed free compost or topsoil
aerate the soil: the best method is to physically remove plugs of soil (takes more work than using a hard rake)

drainage: does water sit in puddles after a rain? some regrading to let water flow off the turf might help
use a hard rake to physically remove the moss before seeding and top dressing

Fire is a great idea. I highly recommend it. I had a stump in my yard a few years ago and a friend lit a small fire on top (enough to burn for an hour or so) and just left it. The fire burned out the stump and all the roots which subsequently collapsed. There was a bit of a hole to be filled, but it was gone within 48 hours and about 20 minutes of light labour. No digging. No special equipment.
Obviously there are dangers to lighting fires in your yard so take resonable precautions. Also don't do this if the stump is above gas mains...

Mulch helps a lot in this kind of situation.  I'm thinking of ordinary pine/cedar/hemlock bark mulch.  Before mulching, cut the grass as low as you can, or pull the tops off if it's too intermingled in the sedum to cut.  When the grass grows through the mulch the roots are a lot shallower, and there's less of it.  Because the roots are shallower, and because the soil underneath is moister, pulling grass without harming the plants around it becomes a lot easier.  But resign yourself to losing some of the sedum when you do weed it.  It will grow back!

The big issue about daytime watering is that of evaporation. Here in Texas you will waste a large percentage of the water (especially if spraying) and it is against bylaws in summer in most cities.
In cooler climates, night time watering is thought to encourage to mould and rot. I don't ever recall this being an issue with lawns when I lived in the UK (where it rains at night!)

3874,"I have some heritage ""Strawberry"" popcorn plants in the garden, and I've realised I don't know when to harvest them. Though it might be possible to eat it while still fresh and juicy, I intend to pop it into popcorn so the kernels presumably need to be left longer than sweetcorn to mature. Is there some way I can tell when it's ready to harvest?
Edit - here's the end result (well, not quite, as I haven't popped it), to be left in the kitchen like this to dry for a couple of weeks:



Iowa State University Extension says:

Allow the kernels to dry in the field as long as possible. When harvested, the kernels should be hard and the husks completely dry.

I've never grown popcorn, but it looks like a hard freeze can damage the kernels. So let it dry in the field as long as you can, and harvest prior to any hard freezes. I'd probably also want to pick it if I knew there was a lot of wet weather coming and the corn wouldn't dry any more outside.

3879,"In winter, the next-years growth spikes of some of my Regal Blue Hostas got trampled off, and now that they're up, the leaves all have blunt-ended, ragged ends that curl and ripple. This is right by the house, and I would like to know whether I can expect them to self-repair in a reasonable amount of time (like under a year), or should I plant something in front of it. 


The existing leaves won't heal this year. New ones will be fine.
This is true for most leaves: damage is not repaired.
Leaves decrease in efficiency as they age so from the plants point of view why invest more energy in an older leaf when a new one will yield a better return.
Edit: if you remove old leaves from a vigorous healthy plant it will not weaken it. I grant that if you remove every leaf from the plant that is a set back.  It depends on the overall percentage of damaged leaves. If all are damaged take one or two at a time every few weeks.

It's a millipede.  They usually aren't a pest, unless things are very wet and/or you've got a lot of woody mulch - in which case they are one of those things that may swarm and denude your plants at night, like earwigs.
"
3892,"Last night I found that earwigs have been eating my newly planted basil plants. They have only been in the ground for a few days, and it didn't take long for the earwigs to find them.
The planted ones are lost. I have read this question about millipedes, which mentions removing debris, so I'll start with that. 
Is there anything I can do to prevent earwigs from eating any more herbs that I would like to plant?


Earwigs like to come out at night when you're not looking and eat flowers and new growth.

Remove mulch like bark or piles of leaves from the immediate area.
a thin layer of diatomaceous earth around the basil will discourage them. However this will have to be redone after a rainfall

Longer term solutions are

consider where you have planted basil as your ""trap"" area. Plant more basil that you want to keep in clay pots or other containers in a different area.
encourage natural insect eating predators such as frogs.  They need water, shelter and lots of insects to eat.

You can purchase a Y adapter that fits on the tap and gives you two feeds:

You can also chain these to give you 3 feeds by using 2 adapters.  This however requires a lot of hose. You can also find sprinklers that have an IN and OUT feed so that you can daisy chain them:

As you can see, there is an end cap you can remove and then add another hose to the next sprinkler.  This is often preferred as it requires less and shorter hoses all over the place.

3913,"At my local supermarket they are selling peppermint seeds. How is it possible? I thought peppermint was a sterile hybrid, and only reproduced through stolon.


TL;DR: They're seeds that will grow up to be a peppermint, not seeds that were made by a peppermint.

Yes, peppermint is a hybrid (specifically an F1 hybrid) of two other species of mint, spearmint and watermint.  Hybrids between species are generally sterile, but since the parent species are fertile, one can pollinate the other to make the peppermint seeds that you're seeing.  The hybrid plants share characteristics from the two parent species.
(Another, much more remote possibility: most F1 hybrids are sterile, but they can sometimes be fertile; their children are called F2 hybrids, and their characteristics can vary across the entire spectrum between the two original parent species.  It's possible that your supermarket happened upon a source of fertile peppermint.)
"
3918,"I've been reading about tree fertilizers and urea constantly comes up as a good source of nitrogen for trees. Let's say your dogs always pick the same tree to urinate on every day. Would that tree be healthier, grow faster etc. as a result?


In one word, no.
Dog urine contains high concentrations of nitrogen and salts. The concentrations are sufficient to burn grass roots.  Tree roots near the surface are only slightly woodier and just as subject to burn.
For mature trees they can probably deal with the root burn in localized areas.  A freshly planted tree might have a harder time depending on the number of dogs.
Edit: @David High nitrogen levels kill roots in a small localized zone. After the urea has been broken down into nitrogen that is available then new roots can make use of it. Dogs tend to be consistent on where they urinate so you get a cycle of root burn followed by new root growth in the kill area and then more root burn. This does not help a tree grow.

3929,"We recently moved into a new house that has a flower bed that is completely infested with weeds. It's basically solid weeds. We spent the day hand-weeding and getting rid of most of what we can see.
What else can/should we do to prevent the weeds from returning? Have we done enough? 
We plan on planting annual wildflowers, which I guess are sort of weeds themselves. Also, we plan on planting strawberries. 


Here's the thing, no matter what you do the weeds will return. Eventually. Here are some things you can do to slow them down.

put down some weed blocking fabric (available in your hardware store or wal-mart).
mulch around your new flowers when they come up
weed regularly

It's hard work keeping a bed free of unwanted plants, there is no magic solution and the things I mentioned above are deterrents, the weeds will eventually come back, because good healthy soil, the kind you want for your plants, is exactly the thing they crave.

3937,"My lawn was overrun with dandelions so I've used some Ortho Weed-B-Gon Max and that seems to be killing the dandelions very well. The problem is now  my lawn is very sparse with grass. There just wasn't much grass there after killing the dandelions. I've thought about reseeding but every bag I look at wants me to till up the ground before putting the seed down. I've also thought about just using fertilizer but wasn't sure if that would do enough or even help the dandelions survive the herbicides. 
What is the best approach to getting my lawn back to full grass the easist and cheapest way possible. 


The label for this product does not recommend applying grass seed until four weeks after the last application.
Once this waiting period is up buy or acquire:

a big bag of grass seed suitable for the light and soil in your lawn
enough compost or top soil to cover the sparse areas to a depth of 1/4"" to 1/2""

Then

Use a rake to open up the soil.
Apply grass seed at a generous rate
top dress with compost or top soil
water in and continue to water until the seed sprouts

Do this twice a year in the spring and fall and you can put your Weed-B-Gon away!

3940,"I just moved into my first house, :) and I have two big bushy trees in the front yard. (I'm unsure of the identification for them. Anyone know?)
At one time it looks like they were lanscaped, but since have started growing sturdy green shoots from the base.  See below pictures.  Am I safe to hack that weed like thing out of there?  It's pretty tough.  Any recommendations how to do this if that is so?  (Ax?)




Here's my guess at what you're looking at.  The tree took a huge amount of damage some time in the past as evidenced by the dark line running up the trunk.  I'm guessing this is a grafted tree and after the damage the original root system decided to ditch it's partner further up the trunk and grow it's own leaves.  From the thickness of the little stems this was allowed to grow for some time.

Dig the sucker growth out back to the trunk while trying to minimize damage to the root system.
try and identify the tree. We need location and a closeup of the leaf and bark
consider doing some pruning to let more light in and promote new growth on the upper part of the tree.  If you don't know how consider an arborist or landscaper or ask another question here.

3941,"Unfortunately we don't have a proper garden, but we do have an area that we can use for pots and/or grow bags. We've been offered some raspberry canes by a friend - but will they grow ok in pots or growbags, or do they need to be in the ground?
I can't seem to find any information online - what would people suggest?


They will grow to a normal size if they are given about 8 cubic feet (2'x2'x2') of good topsoil. Potting soil has to be fertilized more often. Keep them moist and give them at least a half day of sun for best production. You can use grow bags, but pots or planters are more stable and work better long term. I experimented with this and found that I could grow raspberries in pots as small as eight inches, but the smallest pot in which they would grow to a natural size and produce normal amounts of berries held about 8 cubic feet of soil. pot grow brambles are best pruned short (3'). Always prune after temps average under forty degrees Fahrenheit, to reduce the risk of disease. Cut any cane that produced fruit to the ground level, thin out the new canes to the strongest few (6 max.) and cut those canes and any branches on them to tree feet of the ground.

3945,"I've been contemplating putting up a fence, but I'm not exactly sure how high it should be.  Can anyone point me to some instructions on what specs a good deer fence should have as well as how to build it?  
I have also seen motion sensor sprinklers that claim to scare deer away when they get too close.  Has anyone had any luck with these?  If it would work I would rather go this route.


This article goes into extensive details on electric fencing.  Fencing that is not electrified should be at least 8 feet tall. A detailed description is found here.  Sadly these solutions require time, money and a post hole digger or a tractor.  
Deer pose a different problem for every gardener. A hungry deer will go to far greater lengths to eat your garden than ones that can survive on their normal diet.
You will also find suggestions to use bars of soap, human hair, dogs or getting a hunting licence. These will work for some deer, some of the time but if you want a solution for all of the deer, all of the time you need a fence.

Is there anything I could have done to have saved the tree?  Or prevent the infestation?


Assuming that you have not been bringing wood pallets from China to your home there isn't anything you could have done.
This website from Illinois University is informative.  The ash borer is spreading slowly throughout North America and the only solution we have is to cut down ash trees.  Thousands have been cut where I live and many more will be as the pest spreads out.
There are no proven solutions using biological predators in use now and no resistant varieties yet.
From various articles it seems likely that predators and new cultivars based on Chinese or Korean Ash should be available within ten years.

If I pick my strawberries like this can I leave them a couple of days near a window so the other half goes red?
How do commercial growers deal with this issue?
If I leave them there until fully ripened I am worried the top half will get spoiled before the back end has time to go red.
My second issue with leaving them to ripen is that they get consumed quickly by other creatures (bird/mice/insect) before I can eat them.


In order to deal with harmful insects & birds you can make a scaffold around strawberries and cover them by plastic or PEfilm like greenhouses. 
IMO, if you give them time to ripe, keep the temperature between 15-25 ^C and sunlight their color completely will be red.
Edit: more clarified.

I had a friend tell me that I could put about the last 2 inches of green onions in a shot glass or other small glass, fill it with water (being sure to leave to top sticking out), then stick it in my window sill so it gets a lot of sun, and they will re-grow! You just have to keep an eye on the amount of water so it doesn't dry up. I've been doing it for the last couple of weeks and I have about 12 growing. Some are already ready to use! 
"
3969,"I've planted Basil (from a pot) outside and it's been very wet in the last few weeks. The plant has now got these grey spots on it. What is wrong with it?



That is leafspot, or pseudomonas cichorii. It is a bacteria that lives in the soil and infects the plant when soil is splashed onto the leaves
There is no cure for bacterial leaf spot for homeowners. Growers could use streptomycin or copper maneb but I would not use these for something I was going to eat.  
Here are some recommendations:

Minimize the damage by making sure that your basil plants have plenty of air circulation and that they are watered in a way so that the soil is not splashed onto the leaves.
Remove all infected leaves as well.  
There appears to be a link to growing at cool moist temperatures.  Try to provide a sunnier, drier environment.

4002,"I'm trying to build an aquaponics system with PVC. I have 3"" pots on 3.5"" tube. When I was done with the drilling and positioning I noticed that the water just rushed below the pots, not touching them. Do I need pots that are longer or do I have to place them somewhere else while the roots are big enough to reach the bottom of the tube?


You could use a wicking system which is also known as capillary matting.  Put a strand or strip of absorbent material into the root ball at planting time. Put the root ball and wick into a pot.  Tease the wick so it sits in water.
Shoestrings or polyester fleece are materials that you may have in your home.  Any hydroponics store should have material that lasts longer.  This works best when the distance from the water to the pot is no more than a few inches.

4008,"I have the following plants, each with their own drip feed:
Corn

Bush beans

I have a bunch of drip ends that are 1 gallon per hour, would it be good enough use these for an hour a day on all of my plants or do some of the above require more/less water?
Also, should I break up my watering or just do it all at once?


The rule of thumb I've often heard is 1"" per week, but I know that some vegetables like more water (e.g. celery) than others. (And yields decline in tomatoes with less water, but the flavor is supposed to be incredible in ""dry farmed"" tomatoes. YMMV.)
Figure out how long it takes to deliver 1"" of water (do the math using your square footage and 1 gal/hour), then run it for that long.
Do it all at once, and do it infrequently. It's better to soak the soil and get the water deep. That encourages the plants to send roots deeper into the soil. Frequent, shallow watering leads to shallower roots.
If you have a moisture probe, use it. Once your plants are established, check to see how much moisture you have deep in the soil. If the soil is moist enough, you don't need to water.

4016,"I planted a dwarf orange this winter.  It came from the nursery with oranges already on it.  They are still green, and one split through the skin so I cut it off.  Should I leave the rest on?  Or would it be better to let the tree get established and take all the green fruit off?


A lot depends on the local environment where the tree is. At the grower's, conditions were optimized for growth and fruit production.  If your tree has good light, humidity over 30 or 40 percent and a regular watering and fertilizing schedule with a citrus fertilizer that provides chelated minor nutrients, then leave the fruit on.
A tree in less than optimum conditions can still flower and set fruit but a good practice would be to do some thinning at fruit set so it can grow a few fruits well.
Watch out for spider mites on the underside of the leaves if it is dry (humidity less than 30 percent on a regular basis). Soap and water on a dishcloth wiped on the underside of the leaves will control them.

It's thistles.  You're probably doing the right thing - just keep at it.  This time of year, weeds can seem unbeatable.  
The main thing is to loosen the soil out about a foot from a big thistle, with a gardening fork or similar.  Then try to get all the roots in one go with a spade, or by pulling.  With little ones that regrew from little roots you missed, you don't have to go out so far.

4039,"I recently bought a house and have this 250 sqft backyard with really tall grass (about 7 inches). I found an 18"" push reel mower and an electric trimmer (weedeater) thing in the garage. The reel mower is not able to cut anything, I guess, since the grass is really tall plus the blades looks really dull to me. So my question is: can I use the electrical trimmer to cut 1/3rd of the grass in the entire lawn a couple of times and then go back to using the reel mower when the grass gets manageable. I mean, is it OK to use the trimmer for the lawn, or are they specifically meant for edges and would destroy the lawn if used to cover the entire area?


Well a trimmer won't destroy the lawn but it won't do a good job.  It is difficult to keep the trimmer head at exactly the same height. 
Try this:

Use a sharpener on the blades, even sandpaper will help.
oil all the moving parts of the mower, WD40, lubricating oil or whatever comes to hand
Do wear protective gear when using a trimmer. Gloves and glasses are essential if you don't know what's overgrown under the grass
using the trimmer reduce the lawn height to three to four inches
use the reel mower to give a nice clean cut.

Edit: Ok, maybe not WD40...

4041,"The last two mornings I have come out to find 4 or 5 of my newly planted vegetables dug up out of their holes. The plants themselves appear to be undamaged so I just keep replanting them in the hole that some creature dug it out of.
What could be doing this and what is it looking for? My best bet is raccoons, but I have never heard of them doing stuff like this.
FYI I live in Northern California in the foothills.


Do you have grubs? Last year I had a lot of grubs. For a few days, I'd go out and find that my basil had been dug up -- nothing was eaten, just a bunch of digging around that happened to damage the plants.
I think it was a skunk -- I saw the skunk one day at dusk, not in the garden, but heading towards the fence. I also saw what I believe to be skunk turds in a couple of places around the fence and inside the garden. Skunks like grubs?
When I inspected the entire perimeter, I found a small gap that it must have been getting through. After plugging the gap, nothing was disturbed. My (apparently skunk-proof) fence is mostly 4 and 5' welded-wire, with a couple sections of 4' chicken wire. The bottom isn't buried in the dirt everywhere, but where it isn't buried, I've got rocks piled up on both sides of the base.

It's a slime mold, a weird primitive organism that has spores but isn't fungus.  See also (as usual) Wikipedia.  
It's not harmful.  In a very few places, one phase of this, when it's transparent ""slime"", is eaten.  No thanks.  It made (non)fungus of the month in 1999 - what an honor!

Probably not.  The active ingredient in the new iron-based weedkillers is a specific iron chelate - specifically, iron HEDTA (Hydroxyethyl Ethylenediamine Triacetic Acid).  AFAICT, this isn't used in diet supplements.

Landscape fabrics are made of woven polypropylene which is considered to be stable, or safe, for organic gardens.  As it is woven it will allow water through it.

4078,"This is a follow up to Protect flowering fruit trees from frost
Background: We have several fruit trees in our back yard.  They are in full bloom at the moment.  It was supposed to be pretty cold last night. (I don't know what the actual low temperature was here overnight.)
We had enough tarps and Christmas lights to cover some trees, but not others.  So, other than waiting several months, is there a way to tell if the uncovered trees were damaged by the cold?  


The flowers will simply fall off, or if they are past that point the fruit turns very dark, and becomes translucent, it will then darken and dry out... I assume you know by now, how did it go?

In addition, there are slight pits on both surfaces of the leaf, either brown or grey. 



Basil is not very cold hardy and damage from just a touch of frost looks like this. Once a plant is weakened in cool damp weather the usual bacterial suspects move in.
I would pick off the damaged leaves and hope for warmer sunnier weather.

4131,"We bought a house in the winter and once the snow cleared and things started growing, we noticed this low laying plant covering large sections of our lawn. It is mostly in the very shady areas and completely takes over those areas.
It is nice to look at, and where it is there is so much shade I would need to plant a shade grass. I don't mind it, as long as it stays in place and doesn't try to take over the rest of the yard.
EDIT I live in Minnesota so I get lots of ice and snow (most winters).




I hate to break the news, but this is Creeping Charlie, Glechoma hederacea, an invasive lawn weed in moist and shady areas. It normally stays low (2-4""), but can get up to 10"" under ideal conditions. It grows as a mass of creeping stolons over the ground like a carpet, rooting at the leaf nodes to form a dense mat. It will generally stay out of a thick, vigorous lawn, but is a constant trouble in areas where people try to grow grass in the shade.

4133,"I went to stir my compost pile the other day, and to my surprise, when I dug into the center of the pile, I found that it was hot. As in, really hot. Once I removed the top layer steam was literally rising off of it. I didn't have a thermometer handy, but I'm estimating that the temperature was at least 50 C (120 F) based on how hot it was to the touch.
Is this normal? Is it good/bad? How much hotter could my compost heap get?
(Note: I have a big compost heap, due to having a big yard that creates a lot of yard waste.)


I know this is an old post, but no one has answered the title question. The answer is, too hot; as in under certain circumstances organic material can auto ignite, almost always found in hay/straw piles. The limiting factors for compost temp are:  The Net r-value from the most central part of the pile, availability of oxygen and water. 
A garden compost pile will generally never get too hot, as they are generally modest in size (less than 2m^3)

4143,"I'm in the process of planting my garden, and I had planned 3 ft wide raised beds with a single soaker hose running down the center of each one. I am using a square foot layout, so there will be 3 rows across most of the beds. Will this hose layout be enough to reach plants that are in the outside 2 rows? Or do I need to run 2 hoses between the rows, so they're 18"" apart? I'm not sure if soil composition or density will greatly affect the moisture distribution or not. Is this just something I'm going to have to experiment with to determine?



After a week of observation and some supplemental watering with a regular spray nozzle, I ended up buying more hose and running two down each bed between the rows. The water wasn't reaching the outermost edges of the beds with only one hose. When I water now, the entire bed is moist.
Side note: It turns out that a regular spigot has problems with supplying enough water for 8 soaker hoses totalling 500' running in parallel. I have a splitter setup that allows me to run half the garden at once, then I can switch to the other half.
Also, since my yard was slightly sloped away from the spigot, I couldn't even run 2 hoses in series. I wanted to try a 75' hose + a 50' hose in series wrapping back towards the top of the garden for each bed. The second hose wouldn't weep the last 25' though, so I had to buy another 4 way hose splitter and feed everything from the top end.

Once all the bricks are lined I will also be getting some nice treated wood to build around them. This will be mainly just for aesthetics but I guess could also help hold the blocks in place.


Cement blocks will work but are likely to make your soil alkaline.    By adding cement you are definitely going to  adding a chemically active compound to your bed. Why not use rebar or T-Bars to stabilize your wall?
Also, from a structural point of view, unless you prepare a bed of crushed stone to a depth of 6"" or more that has been compacted cement will not hold the blocks together if the soil heaves due to frost or cold.

I've seen it done with one row of blocks laid right on the ground -- gives you the same height that a single 2x10 plank would. Two rows might work ok without cementing them together if you do some prep work for a foundation (coarse sand or stone, 4-6"" deep). At three rows, you'll definitely want to do foundation work and tie them together. If I were doing it three rows high, I'd mortar the joints instead of just dry stacking them (it will look nicer and you won't need to pour cement down the holes). On a solid foundation, this won't need any external support (I have a 10' wall built from 6x16x8"" blocks, built on a concrete foundation, that is not going anywhere.)
As a pro, if you put in the up-front work and do it right, it will last just about forever.
As cons, the up-front work is time consuming, requires some skill to get it right, and once you're done, it will last just about forever, whether you want it to or not. ;)

4155,"I planted strawberry seeds on coconut seed starters. The seedlings did come, and I got two nice set of round leaves (the cotyledons I guess) for each seed followed by a new pair of nice, real leaves. The seedlings grew to approx half a centimeter high, with the leaves being a little smaller than the length of a grain of rice. I was extremely happy about it but then I realized the growth stopped. It's like they are stable in that size since weeks. I keep the coconut starters wet from below, adding water to the base plate once every three days.
I am keeping the seedlings inside, on a front window. I receive very little sun. Is it the expected life cycle for the plant, or is it due to some problem ? 


Coconut husk doesn't have much in the way of nutrients; which makes it great for starting seeds on because they don't damp off as easily as soil grown seedlings, but it is probably time to either transplant into potting mix, or fertilize with some sort of gentle weekly type of liquid fertilizer if the seedlings aren't big enough, or you don't have a place to put them...

Developmental abnormality, when the stem was very small some chemical signal got slightly messed up, sometimes maples get three seeds, I had a watermelon with three cotyledons this year... A four leaf clover would be the same sort of thing.
The stem is genetically the same as the stem it was connected to, stems growing from this one will likely be flat.

You might have a case of ants farming the aphids.  If this is the case, tackling the aphids will not likely be productive as the ants will just replace the aphids.  I suspect you will need to attack the ant nest directly.  The suggestion I thought would work best from the above link was pouring boiling chili water down the nest.

A teaspoon of dish soap mixed with a quart of water and sprayed on will knock down the population of aphids and kill some ants.  Leave it on a minute or two and give the plant a good wash down afterwards with water.  (This is in case it is a plant with delicate leaves like lettuce or the mixture has too much soap and the fatty acids burn the leaves.)

Mint does not care for being mowed. If you just assert your ownership of that bit of the lawn, and mow and weed whack as you prefer, eventually it will be less minty. Oregano, in contrast, seems to decide to become a creeping ground cover in the face of endless mowing, which isn't entirely a bad thing. We have fragrant walking paths.
Sure, while there are still full mint plants somewhere nearby, plants will continue to pop up in your lawn. But it's not like poison ivy or something. Mow them and enjoy the smell.

Oh boy! I made the same mistake and now mine occupies about 3-4 times the area in the pic on the right here (that was taken last Oct). It's hard to tell if you're really done pulling it out, because the stolons could have propagated quite far. 
I don't know of an easy way (I doubt there's one...). The approach I'm taking now is to mercilessly cull most of it (leaving only what I need). Later, when it pops up in a new area, I dig around and cull that. That way, I don't break my back trying to dig in places where I can't be sure if it's there or not. Besides, as Kate mentioned, it's not really a bad thing — I don't mind its smell, and it certainly has uses. So I'm not desperate to get rid of it in one sitting.

(This is generic advice for increasing nitrogen -- I don't know much about hops specifically.)
Yes, a feeding of compost tea is an ok way to add nitrogen. The actual amount of nitrogen you will add depends on what went into the compost.
A better amendment for a quick nitrogen boost (don't overdo it!) is blood meal. Sprinkle some on the soil around the plants, and then water to let it soak in.
This is a temporary fix, the nitrogen will either get used up, or it will leach deep into the soil, or even volatilize into the air over time. So you may want to repeat this -- with small amounts -- every couple of weeks. A longer term fix would be to put an inch or so of composted manure around the plants; this will provide a source of slow-release nitrogen that will feed the plants over time. Repeat the application in the spring.

4195,"I am trying to grow mint. I did repot the plant cutting away excess roots. I placed the plant where it gets direct sunshine for about half a day and water the plant occasionally. It does pretty well with leaves showing up in a few weeks.
The questions I have is about ""harvesting"" the mint leaves. I read about cutting the flowers when the plan starts flowering, but I have no idea what the flowers look like(especially new ones). Also when I cut the leaves off a branch, the branch seems to dry up and die in a few weeks. So I would like to know about which leaves to cut, where (leave a little leave stem, all of the stem, etc.), distribution(all on one stem, location), leaf size, etc.
In the picture below, the plant has plenty of leaves, but the stem on the right seems to be dying because I took all the leaves from that stem?
 


I am growing one variety of mint in my garden and I always harvest it much in the same way that Ed Staub suggested.

Namely, I take the younger leaves, not the older ones. I don't just harvest the leaves, but I break the stem somewhere in the middle. Over time, new ""shoots"" are formed from this stem.

I sometimes even use scissors and cut down several stems, especially in the end of the season. I have heard that this propagates growing of the mint.

However, I am raising my mint in the garden and thus I have a lots of it. I am not sure if this method will be beneficial for potted mint.

Well it isn't dead, as the stem seems quite green. If you are interested from a botany/plant physiology standpoint let it grow.
There will be nodes where there used to be leaves. These will regrow new branches, but if you are in a hurry for tomatoes, go out and buy a new one, the biggest one that you can find cheaply.

Moss grows in a variety of environments and plants like Irish Moss may be of interest to you as well given the similar appearance.
Moss cannot out compete grasses or other perennials except in special environments (think temperate rain forest).

You would need to remove the competitors such as grasses.
provide shade
provide a soil that is damp or retains moisture well (peat moss helps)
low traffic area
allow for weeding to remove wind blown seeds

@Ed Staub You're right that there are factors that are not clearly understood about moss growth.  I have a patch just out the front door: north facing, heavily compacted, heavy foot traffic, clay base soil.  This is not an ideal environment for anything much less moss.

I'm ok with having to buy worms every season (I see that the red wiggler is the worm to get) but am curious about the experience of other vermicomposters in NY and the Northeast.  I've read that an active compost pile can have a temp of 125 degrees Fahrenheit. I assume that worms will move out of my compost material when it gets that hot but what happens in the winter when it gets near zero?

Would they work ok if I connected them all together or would it be better to use a 3-way splitter on them? If it helps the hoses I was looking to get are these.


As long as your tap can provide the required pressure to get a decent flow all the way to the end it should work in series, however you will find that running the hoses in series will lead to greater pressure nearer the tap, so I would recommend a splitter to make all 3 hoses have similar pressure and flow characteristics.
"
4260,"I recently started composting, and I was reading about top-dressing. Two questions I have about top-dressing are:

Is there a maximum to it? Most of my reading suggests up to once a year max.
Do I really need to rake it under the grass? Some sites suggest leaving it on your grass (it'll disappear by itself), some suggest raking it until it goes under the soil.

If you're wondering, my backyard area has quite a few weeds (hoping to eliminate most of them), a few small bare patches, and a few areas of yellow/dead grass. I'm aiming to eliminate most of the weeds and get a consistent, thicker grass for this year; maybe some vegetables next year.
Edit: I live in a place where we get cold winters (-20C and under) and hot summers (up to 30C or so).



When: twice a year, spring and fall for areas where there is a cold winter
how much: you should be able to still see the grass. complete coverage could be counter productive if the grass cannot grow fast enough to reach the light.  Whether it will or not depends on your zone and health of grass and soil
raking helps but is not necessary unless you put a lot on
the first part of top dressing is adding more grass seed.  By seeding twice a year the lawn can stay thick with less room for weeds.  Fall seeding works well as the seed will not germinate till spring when there should be more moisture.

4263,"I have a small open compost bin, it's now full with layers of brown and green. I read somewhere that I need to turn it occasionally (weekly is ideal), and that I need to keep a 1-4"" layer of browns (shredded newspaper is good) on top to prevent bugs/pests/etc.
How do I reconcile these two? Turning it will mix everything up and will disrupt the layer on top. Do I need to then re-layer it on top? I didn't leave that much space.


The ideal time to turn it is after the temperature starts to drop. Depending on your recipe, this may take more or less than a week.
As far as not having space, the pile will magically shrink as it composts. By the time it's done, it will generally reduce in volume by 1/3.
When you turn it, you have options:

Don't worry about re-covering it with browns. You may end up with bugs if you leave bug food on the surface. You could put a lid 
Cover it with a thin layer of browns -- whatever fits after you've turned it, even if it's just ½"".
Cover it with a thin layer of garden soil.
Wait to turn it until it has reduced in size.
Don't fully turn it; give it a stir so that you get some air mixed into the center.

Should I sow new seeds? Is it better to sow them in my garden or in a pot? The current pot is in a really sunny position that can get really hot in the afternoon.


Yes, generally any salad green's leaves get tough and bitter when they start flowering / setting seed. At this point, you should pull them up and plant something else.
I don't know about rocket specifically, but warmer weather and/or longer days often trigger flowering. If your garden provides more shade or a cooler environment, your rocket may grow better. But if you can't provide an ideal environment, you may want to try growing something more adapted to warmer weather and replant rocket as cooler weather approaches in late summer / autumn.
Salad greens that work better for me in the summer would include beets, chard, or some heat-adapted varieties of lettuce.

Most tree roots are within six inches of the surface where there is air and water that is freely available. Any kind of tilling or compacting will have a negative effect on the trees health.

You do not want to be adding a foot of soil to the base of a mature tree. That will suffocate the roots and likely weaken the tree. Maybe consider some alternatives. A bit of mulch and perhaps a few containers rather than an entire raised bed?

4320,"I have a parsley plant (in its second year), and I think it has 'bolted'?, so it not really producing lush green stalks that I can use for cooking.

Can I salvage it? Or is it too far gone?


Yes, your parsley has bolted. You might be able to use some of the green leaves at the bottom, but the stalks are definitely going to be tough and stringy, unlike when the plant is young. Typically, parsley still keeps producing some good leaves when it has bolted (at least, the people I gave the leaves to didn't say it tasted bad). I don't like parsley, so I can't say much about the taste, but my experience with cilantro and lettuce has been that the leaves get bitter (or off-taste) when the plant has bolted. 
You could try cutting the stalks and prolonging the plant's life, but I would suggest getting a fresh new plant and starting the cycle again. Herbs are so easy to grow and new plants are quite cheap, that it's not worth the trouble to keep pushing a bolted plant. You might also find this answer on harvesting herbs useful.

You should be able to use the bottom leaves. 
You can also remove the stems with flowers on them - this should encourage some new growth if you are lucky.
Parsley is a biennial plant, meaning that on the second year it bolts and produces seeds.
To prolong its life, remove the bolting stems as soon as you see them.

Should I plant the sprouts up or down?  (We actually planted them sideways because we weren't sure.)



Long sprouts may mean the potatoes were improperly stored or stored too long.  What you did is a sensible thing.   If the potatoes are not too far gone, you should get some plants to sprout.  Breaking the sprout risks breaking off the meristem; it is possible there may be other viable meristems along the sprout which could cause a plant to grow, but this is not a sure thing.

Your best bet would be a propane fueled flame weeder — something like this. Since the surrounding material (brick) is non-flammable, you can easily direct the flame in the cracks/gaps and burn the weeds out.

4347,"I used a new soil-less method for my recent raised vegetable bed. This is the method I used: Softened the soil by loosening with a fork. Laid soaked cardboard in the diameter of the bed, overlapping each piece. Then covered with a bed of straw, garden compost, wetting each layer. I laid two layers and used peat moss as the last layer, with a finished height of approx 8"" and a bed size of 4x6. I planted corn seeds and covered with mesh. The corn is growing, however, the bed is also covered with ""grass"". What is the best way to get rid of the grass? 


I'd be worried that the cardboard will act as a root blocker and the corn won't be able to develop the deep roots it needs. 
As for the grass...like any weed, you'd need to pull it out. Corn is a grass too, so unless you planted round-up ready corn, you likely don't want to use any grass poisons (not that you'd want to use poisons on your garden anyways).
Once the grass is pulled out, you can put down a layer of weedblock. I typically stake in kraft paper. You could also use a layer of newspaper.

4356,"What is the best way to remove poison ivy from a yard or trees without getting it all over yourself? I figured that even with an herbicide that the dead poison ivy would still need gathered up, and the oils would still cause problems


This may sound crazy, but one way to do it is to get a goat and let it chow down on the stuff. Goats, and pretty much everything except humans, are immune to the effects of poison ivy and they are notoriously voracious. 
Of course they will also indiscriminately eat the rose bushes next to the poison ivy too, so this is only practical if you (1) Can get and contain a goat; and (2) Don't have any plant life you want to save (including trees) near the poison ivy.

We use Roundup on poison ivy. It is restricted for sale here in Ontario, but poison ivy is a permitted use. We don't gather up the dead plants - or in fact notice any. Over the years I have developed a strong sensitivity to it, so I don't participate in getting rid of it, but I have no problems going places that poison ivy used to be, suggesting that the Roundup-killed plants and their oils go away after some number of months. The less you touch it the better, so any form of pulling it up and throwing it away is going to be problematic. The Roundup approach is not particularly easy - each plant gets an individal spray - but it does work.

Your spinach has bolted, and is (probably) no longer edible.
To prevent this, predict warm years ;-) and plant earlier in them.  Seriously, if you see that everything seems a couple of weeks ahead of normal, plant accordingly and hope for the best.  If the weather turns cold against you, you can replant - better to be too early than too late.

My lot is only 60x110 but I bought a Ryobi lithium cordless trimmer and it works great. I spend about 15 minutes trimming the entire yard and can get around 3 trims on one charge. Sounds like that might  work for your 1/2 acre (charging after every trim). It's powerful enough to cut down numerous weeds, it's quiet and the battery works in other ryobi devices. The battery also has a charge indicator button which is useful. You could also just buy a second battery and rotate through them.

4399,"So i know my plants aren't getting enough light, my question is, does it make a difference if I turn on the light as soon as the direct sunlight goes away or if I do it when I get back from work (and the sun has been gone for a while)


It's better to try and mimic nature where there is a continuous period of light followed by darkness.  Some plants need a period of darkness like tomatoes and many flowering plants but other tropical plants are just fine with getting light twenty four hours a day.

If you manage your compost pile perfectly, it will heat up and kill the seeds. I've never managed my pile perfectly and there are always some seeds. Occasionally it's a happy thing -- last year we got a bunch of pumpkins from volunteer plants. Often it's a real pain: raspberry seeds left over from making jam are terrible; we don't put raspberry leftovers into the compost any more.
For the most part, though, I don't bother. A few stray cucumbers, pumpkins, or tomatoes aren't a big deal. They're not terrible to deal with like other weeds -- easy to pull out, they don't resprout, and they won't spread seeds (assuming you don't let them fruit). Sometimes you can get usable fruit from volunteers, but generally speaking I just pull them out.

I use chicken wire to keep squirrels out of my garden.  They are always digging holes there and burying acorns.  One thing I've noticed: they always go for open soil, and once plants are established there they don't seem to dig and bury stuff anymore.  So you might try the mesh until you can get other vegetation better established.

If you somehow make all the compost pile heat up the heat will kill just about anything. However that is very hard - you'll have to thermally insulate the pile so that no parts cool down and the latter will almost likely mean the pile won't be ventes so you will get totally different chemical processes in there and the materials will ferment and turn into silo instead of rotting and turning into compost. So the bottom line is it's very hard to get all the seeds killed.
That shouldn't bother you. Unless you add some very active weed seeds in there removing those accidential plants is not a big problem.

Utah still prohibits RWH outright, but I haven't heard of anyone being prosecuted for doing it on their homestead.
Louisiana, in New Orleans, still has a ban on cisterns because of an old law dating back to French rule that was a response to mosquito outbreaks.
California just adjusted their policy, in spite of Governor Brown's veto of a law that would have established guidelines.  Los Angeles county passed legislation to support RWH there.
Most states have permitting and/or permission restrictions when a RWH system is installed in a service area of a public water supply to insure no cross-connections or backflow problems exist.

4433,"I've heard many people talk about using rock dust when talking about organic gardening.
From what I understand rock dust is made from crushed rocks. If they are to be used in an organic garden I assume they are made from real rocks; rocks that took many years to form.
It would seem to me that using rock dust is less sustainable than using something like sustainable timber. I would appreciate if someone could explain whether using rock dust is a sustainable practice or are we using up a irreplaceable resource?


On the off-chance that you're serious...
No, we are not in danger of running out of rocks.  Erosion eventually deposits the sand and mud in the bottom of the ocean, and when it gets deep enough it makes rock again.  That gets uplifted, either through tectonic uplift or volcanically, at which point erosion goes after it again.  Almost any rock you see has been through this cycle a few times.  Fossils of ancient sea creatures are found in the Himalayas.
Much more significant is the energy used (and carbon emitted) to remove, transport and crush the rock.
I don't know how you would use sustainable timber in lieu of rock dust.  You might explain that.

Do they send out a lot suckers?
Can they be controlled by yearly hard pruning?
How far will the suckers extend?  More than a few feet?

Edit: I cannot mow the plants down in a raised bed. Is it feasible to plant them in a bottomless pail so they only send new canes from the base of the roots and not send suckers under my flagstone path?
Edit: in 2015 the blackberries have been planted for three years in a shady area with good soil and water and three competitive rhubarb plants.  Last winter in USDA zone 4 they were killed to the ground but still managed to grow ten feet in a season.  No berries though.  Rhubarb is doing great!


It will probably depend on the particular cultivar.

We're worried that the plants won't survive four days in direct sunlight without watering, but we haven't found a good solution for automatic watering. I don't want to spend big money on ready-made systems.
We have tried the inverted soda bottle with a pinhole in the cap but the bottle was drained within a few hours. This solution won't work over several days.

If I am not mistaken in Israel in the 60's they pioneered subterranean irrigation with buried terra cotta jars.. Perhaps you could use a clay flower pot with the bottom corked, and the top covered... A few of those buried in your planter may do the trick... The downside would be that you would want to test it first...

Good news is that many things to watch for in deciduous trees are not an issue with citrus. Branches are able to bear heavy loads of fruit, the crop is about the same on pruned or unpruned trees and fruit is produced in all but the most heavily shaded parts of the tree.
Here is what you should do:

prune between February and April in the Northern hemisphere or at the end of the cold season in the southern.
prune to remove dead branches, crossing branches and, if the canopy is dense, to let more light into the interior
eliminate all sprouts coming from the main trunk.  It's easier to remove them when they're small so this is more of a year round task.

Looking at the structure of urushiol, and recalling the rule of thumb 'like disolves like', the most suitable commonly available solvent I would try is rubbing alcohol with vigorous scrubbing.  If you have access to these and know how to use them safely, try methanol, benzene, toluene, (Wikipedia also recommends ether).

Yup, it's an oil - a good de-emulsifier and lots of water will work. All you'll need is laundry detergent and a cheap scrub-brush you can toss at the end of it and your garden hose, no power wash needed, and wear some disposable dish gloves, too.

I wouldn't advise digging a plant out just to fertilize it - especially an annual.  So regardless of the efficacy of bone meal in general, it doesn't seem like a good fit in this case.

4532,"There are many web sites on how to use bone meal with claims like ""Using bone meal will help your flowering plants, like roses or bulbs, grow bigger and more plentiful flowers."" Is this true for all plants, just vegetables and bulbs or not at all?


It is going to be true if it contains nutrient(s) that are in short supply. 
Bonemeal is considered a slow-release high phosphate fertilizer: bones are primarily apatite - a Calcium Carbonate Phosphate, and the phosphate is more tightly bound than in mined phosphates which are often just simple salts (ie. that dissolve easily). It also has a small quantity of nitrates, and I would expect it to make a good source of Calcium (a micronutrient).
So if your soil is short of phosphate relative to your plant's requirements, then yes it would be a good amendment. If the soil isn't short, then you're not going to see much change. Too much and you may even see damage (eg. fertilizer burn). This is true of any required resource of nutrient. E.g. Extra water is only going to be beneficial if it is dry.

Spoiled wine is sometimes converted to vinegar through spoilage. Vinegar is a herbicide. If it's not vinegar and simply ""off"" tasting, it will still contain between 10-18% alcohol by volume, and alcohol is also a herbicide. So, no, don't put poison on your plants.

When wine goes off, it literally ""turns to vinegar"". The ethanol becomes ethanoic acid (=acetic acid or vinegar).
Ethanoic acid is relatively ""weak"" (acidity depends on the concentration, reactivity, and ease that it disassociates the H+ ion - my ""weak"" refers to the latter two properties).
Although a glass of bad wine at a party might be okay with a resilient house plant in a big pot, I would not make a habit of it. ""Dozen litres"" is a lot.
Beds and compost heaps, being larger, and getting water from elsewhere should not be such an acute problem. I would not use the wine for watering though.

tomato blossom end rot is caused (generally) by a lack of calcium, sound like you are amending the soil, but in my area, The Great Basin the lack of calcium is caused by too much limestone clay, causing the soil to be so basic that the calcium isn't available (ie too much calcium means too little available to the plant) introduction of organic matter typically helps, but isn't much of help to established plants, depending on your soil maybe sulfur would help, be sure to water enough also.

When it first started growing it's first leaves looked very similar to a squash plant, but as it grew it turned into this:
Top View
Side View
The leaves have a sort of hairy texture. The stalk almost looks like bamboo, the way there are sections between the leaves.
So, does anyone know the species of this plant? and will it produce edible vegetation?


It looks like a young sunflower.  If you haven't grown them in the past, you could still end up with seeds courtesy of some squirrels or birds.  Without knowing where it came from, it's hard to say if the seeds would be edible, though again, birds and squirrels will certainly enjoy them, and honeybees will love the flowers beforehand.
"
4609,"I would like to grow some mushrooms in my vegetable garden which is in full sun.  Are there any varieties of edible mushrooms that like direct sun?


The only one I know of is the Stropharia aka wine cap mushroom below is text taken from here on planting them
Stropharia always produced best in sun or broken shade with well-drained, moist soil. Mushroom mycelium needs to be mixed with fresh hardwood chips or sawdust. Do not use chips or sawdust from pine, cedar, redwood, eucalyptus, juniper or other fragrant woods. Fresh straw, NOT hay, can also be used, though it doesn't last as long as wood chips. 
The chip/mycelium mix can be used as a mulch in garden beds or sprinkled down the center of caneberry rows. Stropharia always flourished among my raspberries; the combination of berries and mushrooms made good use of space. You can also grow mushrooms between corn rows or scattered among bok choy, kale, lettuces or other salad greens. Keep the patch watered but not wet. 
"
4610,"I received this plant as a gift. It had flowers, but they have long since vanished. The plant seems to be doing fine- it's been putting out new leaves, and it's been six months. I recently moved it into a larger pot, and it's been receiving a few hours of direct sunlight every day. After someone identifies it, I'd be glad to know what to do to get it to flower again, one day.



It's a Kalanchoe, and they typically bloom in spring so it's natural for yours not to be bloom now.  (You can find them blooming in the stores all year round, but those plants have been forced into bloom by their growers.)
To get it to bloom again, give it:

plenty of light -- where you have it looks OK.
moderate water while it's growing, less during winter months. (It's a succulent, so it can stand being a little dry for a while).
regular fertilizer; I use a slow-release fertilizer on mine and feed it a couple of times a year.
room temperatures: they don't like being cold.  I move mine away from its normal home on my kitchen windowsill when it's very cold outside.

It's also a good idea to pinch out the growing tips of the shoots, otherwise the plant can get straggly.
"
4615,"When I uproot my vegetable plants or even sometimes when I remove weeds, I see this white stuff in the soil near the roots:

What is this? Is it harmful? How to get rid of it?


This is called mycelium. It's a fungus that breaks down organic material. You'll find it on bits of wood buried in the soil, on rotting straw or woody bits in compost heaps, on leafmould and manure in the soil. They are not harmful and these organisms play a vital part in the ecosystem in breaking down material so plants can use it.  
It's a good thing when you see this in your soil.
"
4632,"My French bean plants have diseased leaves as shown below:

What can be causing this? The beans themselves are relatively plentiful.
Location: India. Weather In May-June: Hot! > 95F days.
The bottom side of the leaves have small white flying insects as shown below:



You have a little zoo under those leaves.  The flying white insects are white fly.  The long curly lines on the leaf are leaf miners and I think you have spider mite damage too judging by the stippling of yellow areas where the plant juices have been removed by insect activity.
You could do nothing as you only want the beans to harvest or spray a mixture of dish soap and water on the underside of the leaves two or three times at four to five day intervals.
The leaf miners cannot be treated with soap but they are not significant.
Edit: White fly is the most likely pest that fits the description but they could be something else.  Either way spraying with soap and water will control them until harvest time.  
"
4639,"This insect with a rough brownish shell showed up on potatoes at a friend's house in Vermont. I've looked around in books and online and can't find anything that's an exact match. Current control strategy is knocking them into a can of soapy water. (My friend hasn't said anything about them making a stink when removing them.)
Update via email:

Yes, I've had a couple fly away.  Though they're very slow to get moving
  (i.e. very easy to get into the soapy water first).  They're really stuck
  to the leaves, so I have to really scrape them off the leaf.  You can't see
  in the pic, but they leave big round holes (size of pencil eraser at their
  biggest).




It is a Tortoise Beetle (part of Leaf Beetle subfamily), probably Plagiometriona clavata - Common Garden Tortoise Beetle or Clavate Tortoise Beetle.
(The beetles as a group seem to have undergone a number of taxonomic and name changes)
See another excellent picture of one here: http://www.pbase.com/image/28969283
There is some more information about them from the University of Florida here:

4664,"I'm trying to grow chili plants in my dorm room. So far I'm just starting, so I have just four small pots (until they grow larger and I have to give them a bigger home). I'm usually away for only a few days, but especially in summer my absence could be even a few weeks. The biggest problem so far is keeping the plants hydrated during the time that I'm absent from my university city.
One of the solutions that was suggested to me was Tropf Blumat system. Are there other ways of keeping them hydrated?


If they can handle some wet soil I put them in a pan of water that goes 1/2 way up the pot. This has worked for me for over a week. I don't think anything will work for a summer. I have also watered plants well and drained them. Then wrapped the pot in a plastic bag and sealed it to the bottom of the plant with a twist tie. The water gets used by the plant  but doesn't evaporate from the soil surface.  The plant is exposed to the air so it doesn't mold or rot.
"
4666,"I've got some Aunt Molly's Ground Cherries fruiting on me, but I don't know when to pick them.  I've never planted them before.  I've picked a few and they don't taste very good so I'm thinking they're a little early - about a quarter of an inch in diameter. I just don't want to pick them to late.
So my question is, how do you know when they're ready to pick?


According to Diane's Flower Seeds, you should wait until they fall to the ground to harvest them.

Harvest ground cherries when they fall from the plants. They should be eaten when they are fully ripe and have turned from green to yellow.

4679,"We turned our sprinkler system off last weekend so that we could mow the lawn in the morning without the grass being wet. Unfortunately, I forgot to turn the sprinkler system back on and the grass has gotten no water for a week. The grass has large, dry spots where the grass is green/brown. It looks dead but I'm wondering if there's any way to bring it back to life. Any ideas? It's tall fescue (I think) and the weather has been in the high 90s all week. 


If you are going to water after a period of stress then you need to keep watering it to keep it green during the summer.  Grass has no problems going dormant in the summer but the turf opens up for weeds to get a hold.  If you want to keep your lawn to a high percentage of grass and low amount of weeds then it needs to be watered during dry periods otherwise it will go dormant as you have seen.
The other beneficial practice during the summer is to cut the grass high.  As high as you can stand.  Taller grass can cope better with dry conditions, three inches or more during the summer allows more root growth which, in turn, lets the roots get more water.

4683,"I have noticed that there are weeds growing between the bricks in a paved area in my garden, as shown in the attached picture.
How do I remove them? Is there anything I can do so that I can avoid them growing in the first place?



Weeds are tenacious. Nothing is going to stop them from growing forever. Well, nothing you can do that won't be dangerous to your own health or cause other problems.
Given that the pavers are already in place, you can spray the weeds periodically with something like Roundup. This will keep them down. Or use a Weedwhacker to mow them down.
Be careful on a paver walkway to not use flame to burn them down, as that can cause spalling, damaging the pavers. Be careful that you do not put down something that will cause environmental damage to nearby planted areas.

I've used vinegar - it works well, but it does depend on your pavers (hunks of granite won't care, some cement pavers will).  Just keep a small plant sprayer bottle filled with some, and squirt as needed. 
"
4687,"My wife bought a potted ""Christmas Tree"" last year in the week running up to Christmas. It wasn't in the best of shape when we got it and about a week after being inside the house, it shed the majority of its needles, leaving the bottom 1/3rd of the tree ""naked"".
Having moved it outside and letting it enjoy a lot of sun and rain, it's been putting out lots of new growth at the top of the plant and generally seeming a lot healthier. However, very little has happened in that bottom third. The very tips of the branches have produced some new growth, but there's no sign of regrowing needles anywhere on the tree.
Is there anything we can do to stimulate the tree to re-grow its lost needles and rejuvenate the sad parts?


No, I'm afraid not. The vast majority of conifers do not regenerate on dead parts, they simply continue to grow at the tips and top of the plant. Your tree has bare branches at the base and it will remain that way - planted outside in a garden, the bare parts wouldn't be noticeable as the tree got larger, but they'd still be there.

If its just the odd weed here and there, any of the methods described in the other answers. If you find over time that weeds pop up all over, then start using a Path Weedkiller treatment - these are designed for paved areas only, and contain an ingredient that sits in the cracks for a season to prevent regrowth. Best applied in spring.

I agree with Tim, but it's a royal pain to do so.
We put an old (but clean) eve trough in front of our ground cherries, then cut a slot in a piece of cardboard shaped like this ""|\"" and fit it around the plant. Then when the ground cherries fall, they roll down the cardboard into the eve trough for simple harvesting!

A preventive solution after you have weeded is to apply a polymeric sand onto the pavers.  It fills in the cracks and sets to a porous but weed resistant surface.  I initially balked at paying $25 for a bag of sand but was pleasantly surprised at how well this resists windborne seeds.
It will not stop weeds that are already present from growing up but will stop most wind borne seeds from taking hold.
"
4708,"I've seen a lot of information saying that chlorine can be bad for some plants and the suggestion to let the water sit out for several hours before using it on plants. I rarely see anything about chloramine, a common alternative to chlorine in municipal water.
Chloramine doesn't evaporate from the water (which is why it is used) but it has the same anti-bacterial effect.
Will chloramine harm plants the same way chlorine allegedly does?


I am a beekeeper and my bees have used tap water with chloramine for nearly a decade without apparent issues. That's been true for dozens of others who live by. I have not experienced, seen or heard of anything like your one anecdotal case. Do you have any actual research evidence about any of these things? I would love to hear it.
PS No rejection issues with my hummingbird feeders either, and my beer brews fine. It is not enough to start a group and spread scare anecdotes. If there are genuine, researched issues, I'd like to hear them, but scaremongering is just mean.

4717,"I've got a smallish black plastic compost bin in my garden and I recently noticed that an ant colony has taken up residence. This has happened a couple of times in the past, but they tend to move on when I turn the compost (not surprising, given I'm ruining their home).
However, is their presence actually good for the compost? Do they speed up the composting process by aerating it and dining on the 'food' therein? And if so, should I leave them be for a while?
The ants themselves don't bother me.


Ants in compost heaps usually means the heap's too dry. The absence of obvious brandlings and other worms should confirm that. Add water and continue turning it.
"
4718,"I have three large zucchini plants in my garden, and all three have been producing nice fruits for a few weeks.  The last couple days, one of them has started to turn yellow and sickly:


I've never grown zucchini before, so I'm not sure if this is just the natural progression, and the plant's life is over... or if this is a sign of some damage or disease.  If it is the latter, can I nurse the plant back to health? Or should I destroy it so it doesn't infect the remaining healthy plants?

EDIT
In response to @EdStaub's answer, here's a new photo of the base of the plant, at three magnifications:



Look at the stem, down near the base.  Do you see some distinctive brown-orange sawdust-like material?  If so, that's called frass, and your plant is being destroyed by one or more squash vine borers.  The wikipedia article is really good, and shows pictures (at the bottom) of what to look for.
We've tried killing the grubs in the stem, with a hatpin and other things, with partial success.  
Some varieties of squash have some resistance to borers.  I don't know about zucchini, though.

Your lawn will be fine. I don't water my (couch) lawns, ever, and they survive weeks and months of 35-40C daytime temperatures in summer without rain, with no ill effects. The grass just stops growing. Fescue is less drought-hardy than couch, but much the same principles apply - my Dad's fescue lawns get watered once a week or once a fortnight, depending on the level of water restrictions we're under.
Water it as per your normal until it recovers - which it will, given time - and then look at reducing your lawns dependence on you, in case this happens again. As others have said, cut the grass higher and slowly reduce the frequency of watering, but I would also look at whether there are drainage improvements to be made, in the long term (if your soil can't hold water, then you have to water daily to keep good-looking lawn).
"
4730,"I am growing a couple varieties of peppers this year.  They are Red Thai, Bhut Jolokia, and Red Marconi.  What is the most effective way to maximize the amount of fruit I get from them.  They are growing very well and are starting to get peppers on them, but since I live in Western NY I want to get the most out of the short growing season.  Any help is appreciated.


You may get other advice from others, but a good start is to pick them when they are ripe enough and big enough to eat. A pepper will not set as many fruit if it already has a lot of fruit.
I haven't grown the Thai and Jolokia types, but generally hotter peppers prefer hotter weather. I've tried the Italian style (like Red Marconi) but had mixed success in Texas - my understanding is that they are a cooler weather fruit, so you should do well.
The main fruit season for us is September to November. The real trick is to keep the plants growing during the hot summer months. There will be little if any fruit, but if the plant keeps growing, then there will be a good large plant ready for September. If you have a short growing season, then this might be the secret. If growing from seed, you could start them earlier indoors; or if you are buying plants, buy them earlier.

4735,"I have a small basil plant similar to this one:

Mine's actually a bit smaller, but well.
I cut leafs off it for cooking but I try to keep the plant healthy by not using up more than can grow back. I'm under the impression (I'm no expert at all!) that the plant would die if I remove too much leafs.
However, I still want to maximise the output while keeping the plant alive and healthy. So I wonder which algorithm to use when picking which leaf to take. Should I prefer leafs from the top, from the bottom? Perhaps always pick the largest leafs? Does it even matter?


Ask mummy (anecdotal): as long as you put the basil into a large pot you can pretty much cut all of it since basil grows back from its roots. If the ends close to the soil are kind of woody you should leave more stalk over. If it doesn't grow back then it's most likely because that kind of basil would have died anyway.
"
4739,"While inspecting another problem I observed that most of the leaves are having two red dots (or very small bulbs, maybe cocoons) at the stems of their leaves: it is something harmful or even a pest? If so, do I need to do something?



I turn the floor over to Mr. Chas. Darwin:
“Certain plants excrete sweet juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from the sap; this is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of the stipules in some Leguminosæ, and at the backs of the leaves of the common laurel. This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects; but their visits do not in any way benefit the plant.” 
Cherries, too. If you look closely, there will be a pair of staggered glands on the leaf stems; sometimes prominently, like in the species you are growing (Prunus avium aka sweet cherry?), and sometimes far less so, as in the common wild black cherry of North America.

4740,"This honeysuckle with edible fruit is being sold by retailers in my area as the new best thing.  After researching them I planted three varieties to get good cross pollination.  

What experience have people had growing them?  
Do they perform as advertised:  seedless large berries that ripen ahead of most other fruit shrubs?
any pest or disease problems?
how many varieties do you need for good fruit set?  The literature is confusing on this issue.

Edit: we have only ever seen one deer in seven years and it was confused so I can't tell if these honeysuckle are a tasty treat for them. Right now they are just snack size.


Deer don't seem to be an issue with Haskap.  I had a Hosta and a haskap side by side and the the deer took the hosta and didn't touch the Haskap.
On our farm as well, there were no issues with deer an the Haskap.
